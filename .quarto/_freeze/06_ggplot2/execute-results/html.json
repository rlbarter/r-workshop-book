Ggplot2's \"layered grammar of graphics\" equips us with a grammar for data visualization that is similar to the grammar we learned for data manipulation, which used the pipe to add dplyr operations together. \n\nThe \"*gg*\" in \"*ggplot2*\" stands for \"*grammar of graphics*\" and the \"*2*\" stands for \"*2*\" (as in, this is the second iteration of the ggplot library that Hadley Wickham created, the first being lost to the ether.)\n\nIn this chapter, we're going to continue working with the gapminder dataset, and since this is a new quarto document, to do that, we need to load it again:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\ngapminder <- read_csv(\"data/gapminder.csv\")\ngapminder\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 1,704 × 6\n   country     continent  year lifeExp      pop gdpPercap\n   <chr>       <chr>     <dbl>   <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>\n 1 Afghanistan Asia       1952    28.8  8425333      779.\n 2 Afghanistan Asia       1957    30.3  9240934      821.\n 3 Afghanistan Asia       1962    32.0 10267083      853.\n 4 Afghanistan Asia       1967    34.0 11537966      836.\n 5 Afghanistan Asia       1972    36.1 13079460      740.\n 6 Afghanistan Asia       1977    38.4 14880372      786.\n 7 Afghanistan Asia       1982    39.9 12881816      978.\n 8 Afghanistan Asia       1987    40.8 13867957      852.\n 9 Afghanistan Asia       1992    41.7 16317921      649.\n10 Afghanistan Asia       1997    41.8 22227415      635.\n# ℹ 1,694 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that I also loaded the tidyverse library again--it turns out that ggplot2, like the dplyr package from the previous chapter, is one of the core tidyverse packages. This means that rather than loading ggplot2 independently (`library(ggplot2)`), I typically just load the tidyverse library instead (`library(tidyverse)`), which will simultaneously load both the ggplot2 library and the dplyr library (along with a few others).\n\nOur goal in this chapter is to learn how to write the code to create publication-ready data visualizations (as well as quick-and-dirty non-publication-ready visualizations--but those are less impressive). For example, with just a few lines of ggplot2 code, you can create this figure (click the \"code\" button to see the code):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\ngapminder |>\n  filter(year == 2007) |>\n  ggplot() + \n  geom_point(aes(x = gdpPercap, \n                 y = lifeExp, \n                 color = continent,\n                 size = pop / 1000000),\n             alpha = 0.6) + \n  scale_x_log10() + \n  scale_size_continuous(range = c(1, 20)) +\n  labs(x = \"GDP per capita\", \n       y = \"Life expectancy\", \n       title = \"GDP per cap vs life expectancy\", \n       size = \"Population (millions)\",\n       color = \"Continent\") + \n  theme_classic()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](06_ggplot2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of this chapter, you will be able to create a version of this plot yourself! However, it is worth noting what this chapter *won't* cover, which is the actual principles for creating effective data visualizations that tell a compelling story, and deciding *which* data visualizations to use to answer your specific question (or how to come up with good questions, for that matter). While I'd love to cover these things here, at the end of the day, this is an R book, which teaches you how to do practical things in R. \n\nFortunately, there are many resources that *do* teach these things, such as [Storytelling with Data](https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/books) by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic, which is a favorite of mine (and a great resource for learning how to produce effective graphics in general) and even the chapter on data visualization of my book with Bin Yu, [Veridical Data Science](https://vdsbook.com/05-data_viz).\n\n\n## The layered grammar of graphics\n\nTo create a ggplot figure, you start by creating an empty ggplot2 \"canvas\" using the `ggplot()` function. Our \"canvas\" here is the following grey box:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](06_ggplot2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing I need to do is to tell ggplot which dataset object (a data frame/tibble) to use to create my plot, and I do that by providing the name of my data object as the argument of `ggplot()`:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(gapminder)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](06_ggplot2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNothing has changed on our canvas, but now, when we add some \"layers\" to our plot, ggplot now knows where to look for the variables that I will refer to. \n\nTo *add* a layer to my plot, I literally use the plus symbol, `+`. The name of the layer that creates a scatterplot is `geom_point()` (because a scatterplot is made up of a collection of \"points\").\n\nI can add my points layer like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(gapminder) + geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in `geom_point()`:\n!

Specifically, I need to tell it which columns should define the x- and y-coordinates of my scatterplot points. \n\nI do that by providing an \"aesthetics\", `aes()`, function as the argument of my points layer, in which I specify which column defines the x-coordinate (`x = gdpPercap`) and which column defines the y-coordinate (`y = lifeExp`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(gapminder) + \n  geom_point(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](06_ggplot2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we have our scatterplot, and ggplot has even very kindly provided x- and y-axis names! \n\nNote the error that I get if I forget to place my `x` and `y` coordinates inside the `aes()` function, like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(gapminder) + \n  geom_point(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'gdpPercap' not found\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, ggplot can only find your data frame columns (such as `gdpPercap`) when they are referenced inside the `aes()` function.\n\nI like to think of the aesthetics function `aes()` as a secret code that tells ggplot that the objects I'm referring to are columns of my data frame.\n\n\nA common mistake to make is to use a pipe `|>` instead of a `+` to add layers to your ggplot, like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(gapminder) |> \n  geom_point(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in `geom_point()`:\n! `mapping` must be created by `aes()`.\nℹ Did you use `%>%` or `|>` instead of `+`?\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFortunately, the error is quite helpful here--it says \"*Did you use `%>%` or `|>` instead of `+`?*\" This is hinting that the pipe on the first line of my code should have been a `+`.\n\nIf you remember that the pipe works by taking the object on its left-hand-side and placing it into the first argument of the function on its right-hand-side, then it kind of makes sense that the pipe doesn't work for creating layered ggplot objects. \n\nThe code `ggplot(gapminder) |> geom_point(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))`  would be equivalent to `geom_point(ggplot(gapminder), aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))`, but the `geom_point()` function doesn't want a `ggplot()` object as its first argument, it wants an `aes()` object!\n\nAlthough I can't use the pipe `|>` to create my layered ggplot2 figure, the `ggplot()` function itself wants our data object (`gapminder`, in this case) as its first argument, so I *can* pipe my *data* into my `ggplot()` function like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngapminder |> \n  ggplot() + \n  geom_point(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](06_ggplot2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy might I want to do this? I actually do this a lot, usually because I often want to make temporary minor modifications to my data before plotting it (but I don't necessarily want to create a new intermediate object).\n\nFor example, if I want to recreate the scatterplot above just for the year 2007, I could conduct a filter step and then pipe the resulting filtered data frame object into `ggplot()`:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngapminder |>\n  filter(year == 2007) |>\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_point(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](06_ggplot2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPay attention to where I have used `|>` and `+` in the code above!\n\n:::{.callout-warning}\n## `+` versus `|>`\n\nProbably one of the most common errors I make when doing data analysis is getting confused about when I should use `+` and when I should use `|>`. \n\nWhen we are adding ggplot layers, we always use `+`, but when we are chaining functions together, we use the pipe, `|>`. \n\nTo understand why, remember that the pipe, `|>` takes the object on the left and places it into the first argument of the function on the right. This is not what our ggplot2 functions are doing though, these are layering objects on top of one another, and so they use `+` instead of `|>`.\n\n:::\n\n\n\nAlternatively, I could have defined a new object containing the `gapminder` data for 2007, and provided this filtered data frame object as the argument of the `ggplot()` function:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# define a new data frame\ngapminder_2007 <- gapminder |> filter(year == 2007)\n# provide this data frame as the argument of my ggplot() function\nggplot(gapminder_2007) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](06_ggplot2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen do you think I might prefer to do the \"all-at-once\" approach:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngapminder |> \n  filter(year == 2007) |> \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_point(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nversus defining an intermediate `gapminder_2007` object and then creating my plot with `ggplot(gapminder_2007)`:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngapminder_2007 <- gapminder |> filter(year == 2007)\nggplot(gapminder_2007) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I am going to use this filtered 2007 version of the data for anything other than this single plot (e.g., if I am going to create several plots using just the data from 2007), then I would prefer the latter approach, which defines the `gapminder_2007` object, rather than conducting the filtering every time. But if this is the only time I am going to use this 2007 data, then I would prefer the former approach, which avoids defining an unnecessary object, `gapminder_2007`. \n\nIn general, if you are going to be performing the same action multiple times, for example, to create several different plots, then it's more efficient to create an object that you can reuse.\n\nHaving defined `gapminder_2007`, I can now use it to create a new plot, this time a histogram of `lifeExp` values in 2007:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(gapminder_2007) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(x = lifeExp))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

However, I could have provided these aesthetic properties inside the initial `ggplot()` function itself, leaving the `geom_point()` function without any arguments: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(gapminder_2007, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](06_ggplot2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is common when you want to add many layers, all of which have the same aesthetic properties, for example, by adding a `geom_smooth()` layer, which will add a LOESS fitted curve to our scatterplot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(gapminder_2007, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](06_ggplot2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI could specify the aesthetic properties separately in each layer, but this is less efficient since it involves repeating the `aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)` code in each layer like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(gapminder_2007) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +\n  geom_smooth(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](06_ggplot2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you specify the aesthetics inside the `ggplot()` function, you are specifying **global** aesthetics that will be applied to all layers of your ggplot figure, but when you specify the aesthetics inside the individual `geom_` layers, you are specifying **local** aesthetics that will be applied to that layer only.\n\nFor whatever reason, I tend to find myself mostly specifying local aesthetics unless I have many layers all of which are using the same aesthetics. This is just my personal preference though, and it may differ from yours.\n\n## Additional ggplot2 aesthetics\n\n\nSo far we have seen that `x` and `y` are \"aesthetic\" properties of the points in a scatterplot, and `x` is an \"aesthetic\" property of the bars in a histogram. But they aren't the *only* aesthetic properties that we can specify.\n\nFor example, some other scatterplot aesthetic properties that we can specify include `color`, `size`, and `shape`.\n\nYou can specify the `color` of the points using the `color` aesthetic:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(gapminder_2007) + \n  geom_point(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](06_ggplot2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, I'm specifying `color = continent` inside the `aes()` function, which, because it is inside the `aes()` function, tells ggplot2 that `continent` is a column in my data and that it should come up with a unique color for each unique `continent` value. \n\nWhat if I wanted to just make all of the points in my scatterplot \"blue\", instead of based on the `continent` column?\n\nIf I just replace `color = continent` with `color = \"blue\"` (where I'm providing quotes around \"blue\" because I want to specifically pass the *character* value \"blue\"), I get pink-red (salmon?) points instead of blue points!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(gapminder_2007) + \n  geom_point(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = \"blue\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](06_ggplot2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does this happen? The issue arises because a character value (rather than a column name) is provided inside the `aes()` function, which is intended for referencing columns of your data frame. When ggplot sees `\"blue\"` inside `aes()`, it temporarily creates a new column in the data frame filled entirely with the value `\"blue\"` for all data points. This effectively creates a categorical variable with only one category: `\"blue\"`.\n\nSince this new \"column\" has just one unique value, ggplot assigns a single color to represent it. However, ggplot doesn't care what the value is--it just uses the first default color from the ggplot2 palette, which happens to be this nice salmony color (and definitely not blue).\n\nIf you want to define an aesthetic of your plot that does *not* depend on a column in your data, you need to specify it *outside* the `aes()` function. So if we just move the `color = \"blue\"` argument *outside* `aes()`, we get what we wanted (pay close attention to the closing parentheses and compare with the code in the previous chunk):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(gapminder_2007) + \n  geom_point(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp), color = \"blue\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](06_ggplot2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that when I start having several aesthetic properties, I tend to place each one on its own line, but pay attention to the indentation of each line. Arguments of the inner `aes()` function, such as `x` and `y` are placed further to the right than arguments of the outer `geom_point()` function (such as `color`). RStudio will do this automatically for you when you hit \"return\" to move an argument to a new line.

One is good, and the other is not so good.\n\nI'll show you the not-so-good approach first (so you can really appreciate the good approach.)\n\nThe not-so-good approach involves creating separate data frames for Australia and the US and adding a separate line layer for each country. The first line layer will be just using `gapminder_us`, the data frame for the US, and the second line layer will have its own `data` argument to which I'll pass `gapminder_au`, the data frame for Australia:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# define the data frame for the US\ngapminder_us <- gapminder |>\n  filter(country == \"United States\")\n\n# define the data frame for the Australia\ngapminder_au <- gapminder |>\n  filter(country == \"Australia\")\n\n# Create a line plot for the US and then add a line plot layer for Australia\nggplot(gapminder_us) +\n  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +\n  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp), data = gapminder_au)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](06_ggplot2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-37-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere the first `geom_line()` layer is based on the \"global\" `gapminder_us` data frame provided as the argument of `ggplot()`, and the second line is based on the \"local\" `gapminder_au` data frame provided in the `data` argument of the second `geom_line()` layer (when you don't provide a `data` argument, each layer will be based on the global data frame provided to `ggplot()`)\n\nWhile this technically works, this approach isn't great for a few reasons. First, I can't tell which line is which. There is no legend (and it's unfortunately not all that easy to add a legend manually to a ggplot2 figure). Another reason this approach sucks is that it's not scalable. If I wanted to do this for 10 countries, I'd have to create 10 different data frames and add 10 line layers to my plot. No thanks.\n\n\nInstead of adding separate line layers for each country, I can use the `color` or `group` aesthetic to tell `ggplot()` that I want separate lines for each country.\n\nIn the code below, I create a single data frame that contains the data for Australia and the US only, and then I create a ggplot2 line plot, specifying `color = country` inside my `aes()` function, which will give me a separate line for each country:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngapminder |>\n  filter(country %in% c(\"Australia\", \"United States\")) |>\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_line(aes(x = year, \n                y = lifeExp, \n                color = country))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](06_ggplot2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-38-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, each country's line has a different color *and* ggplot has created a legend for me.\n\n\n\nAn alternative if I want a separate line for each country, but don't want each line to have a different color, is to use the `group` aesthetic instead of the `color` aesthetic:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngapminder |>\n  filter(country %in% c(\"Australia\", \"United States\")) |>\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_line(aes(x = year, \n                y = lifeExp, \n                group = country))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](06_ggplot2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-39-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, the following code creates a line plot of `lifeExp` by `year` for each country on the entire \"Americas\" `content` (with no colors or legend).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngapminder |> \n  filter(continent == \"Americas\") |> \n  ggplot() + \n  geom_line(aes(x = year, \n                y = lifeExp, \n                group = country))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](06_ggplot2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-40-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n## Exercise\n\nCompute the average life expectancy for each continent for each year, and then create a line plot of the average life expectancy for each continent over time (each continent should have its own different colored line).\n\nHere is an example of the plot I want you to make:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](06_ggplot2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-41-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngapminder |> \n  group_by(continent, year) |> \n  summarize(mean_life_exp = mean(lifeExp)) |> \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_line(aes(x = year, \n                y = mean_life_exp, \n                color = continent))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'continent'.

Below I take the same code and add a `facet_wrap()` layer where I specify which categorical variable in my data I want to use to specify the different plot panels (I write `~country` to create a separate panel for each value in `country`). This is essentially just taking each line in the plot above and giving it its own plot. Each plot will inherit the aesthetic properties of the `geom_line()` layer. Note that the `ncol = 4` argument of `facet_wrap()` tells ggplot2 that I want my plot grid to have 4 columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngapminder |>\n  filter(continent == \"Americas\") |>\n  ggplot() + \n  geom_line(aes(x = year, \n                y = lifeExp)) +\n  facet_wrap(~country, ncol = 4)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](06_ggplot2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-67-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Controlling figure output size in quarto\n\nMy previous plot is all cramped, but if I add some `#| fig-height` and `#| fig-width` options to the top of my quarto code chunk, I can control the size of the output in my rendered quarto document, such as\n\n\n```{{r}}\n#| fig-height: 8\n#| fig-width: 8\ngapminder |>\n  filter(continent == \"Americas\") |>\n  ggplot() + \n  geom_line(aes(x = year, \n                y = lifeExp)) +\n  facet_wrap(~country, ncol = 4)\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](06_ggplot2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-68-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that I also rotated my x-axis text 90 degrees using a `theme()` layer.
