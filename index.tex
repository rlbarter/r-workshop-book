Welcome to \emph{The R Workshop Book}!

This book was originally designed as a companion to two R workshops that
I developed and taught at the University of Utah: ``Introduction to R
for Data Analysis'', which I teach over 2 days, and ``Advanced R for
Data Analysis'', which is just a 1 day workshop. So far, I've only
released the book content for the first workshop, but keep an eye on
this space as I'll be progressively releasing the advanced workshop
chapters.

This book, like the original workshops on which it is based, is designed
to get you up and running with using R for the analysis of tabular data
(i.e., data that comes in a table) using the tidyverse, focusing on data
manipulation and data visualization.

My approach is a somewhat less fancy approach to teaching R than many of
the existing modern R books out there, such as
\href{https://r4ds.hadley.nz/}{R for Data Science}, which starts working
working with data and creating visualizations up front. These are great
books, but I personally prefer to teach beginners in a more linear
fashion, which takes a more linear step-by-step approach, starting with
understanding how the programming language works and building up to
fancy things like actually working with data. If you're looking to be
inspired, \emph{R for Data Science} is probably a better book for you.
But if you're looking for a resource to give you the building blocks for
learning R, starting with the absolute basics, then you're in the right
place.

The R programming language is constantly evolving, and my goal is to
keep this book up-to-date as new developments emerge.

\markright{Teaching from this book}

You are absolutely welcome to teach from this book however you like, but
I do request that you provide appropriate attribution.

\section*{Inspiration attribution}\label{inspiration-attribution}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Inspiration attribution}

\markright{Inspiration attribution}

Original inspiration for the first parts of this book came from Software
Carpentry, which is where I first encountered the gapminder dataset that
is used throughout (however, the materials you will find in this book
bear little-to-no resemblance to any of the R Software Carpentry
workshops.)

\part{Getting Started}

\chapter{R, RStudio, and Quarto}\label{r-rstudio-and-quarto}

\section{What is R?}\label{what-is-r}

R is a ``programming language'' that once we can speak (write) it, we
can use it to tell our computer to do things with our data. Just like
learning a real language, learning a programming language involves
learning an entirely new vocabulary along with the grammar rules that
glues it all together. .

Many of you may be familiar with other software programs, like Excel,
SAS, SPSS, STATA, or MATLAB. The main issues with these software
programs, is that they are proprietary and they cost money.

R, however, is what is called an ``*open source*'' programming language.
This means that it is completely \emph{free}, and also that anyone can
be an R developer. The result is that there are massive diverse
communities of people who have come together to contribute to the R
programming language, helping turn it into the powerful programming tool
that it is today.

\section{What is RStudio?}\label{what-is-rstudio}

The \emph{RStudio} ``IDE'', which is the computer application that most
people use to write their R code (RStudio is to R code what a Word Doc
is to text).

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, rightrule=.15mm, toptitle=1mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-note-color}{\faInfo}\hspace{0.5em}{Positron}, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, coltitle=black, titlerule=0mm, opacityback=0, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, arc=.35mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, breakable, toprule=.15mm, colback=white]

I should probably note here that Posit, the company behind RStudio, has
recently developed a new application or ``IDE'' called \emph{Positron}
that will likely eventually supersede RStudio, but Positron still in
``Beta'' mode and, for now, my recommendation is to stick with RStudio.
Rest assured, I'll update this page once I feel like Positron is ready
for general use.

\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Downloading R and RStudio}\label{downloading-r-and-rstudio}

If you will be using R ``locally'' (i.e., on your own computer, rather
than in the cloud), then you will need to download R from the CRAN
website (\url{https://cran.rstudio.com/}). While this will download an
``R'' application in which you can technically write R code, I recommend
that you instead write your R code inside a separate desktop application
called RStudio. You can download RStudio from the Posit website
\url{https://posit.co/downloads/}.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, rightrule=.15mm, toptitle=1mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-tip-color}{\faLightbulb}\hspace{0.5em}{Updating R and RStudio}, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, coltitle=black, titlerule=0mm, opacityback=0, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, arc=.35mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, breakable, toprule=.15mm, colback=white]

Even if you already have R and RStudio on your computer, I recommend
that you re-download them to ensure that you have the latest versions.

It is good practice to keep up to date with the latest versions in
general--I recommend actively re-installing the latest new versions of R
and RStudio at least every 6 months or so.

\end{tcolorbox}

Alternatively, if you prefer not to (or cannot) download applications
from the web onto your computer, you can use R and RStudio directly in
your web browser with \href{https://posit.cloud/plans}{Posit cloud}.

\section{A tour of RStudio}\label{a-tour-of-rstudio}

Since we will be using R inside RStudio, let's start with a quick tour
of RStudio.

Whether you're using RStudio ``locally'' on your own computer, or in the
cloud, when you open RStudio, it should look something like this:

\includegraphics[width=10.22in,height=\textheight]{figures/rstudio_initial.png}

If you go ahead and select \emph{File \textgreater{} New File
\textgreater{} Quarto Document}, type ``My first R'' in the ``Title''
bar and your name in the ``Author'' bar, then your RStudio should look
something like this:

\includegraphics[width=10.22in,height=\textheight]{figures/rstudio_first_doc.png}

Congratulations, you've just created your first R document! Technically,
this is called a \emph{quarto} document, but you can think of it like a
Word document in which you are going to write both regular text and R
code text to tell a data-driven story! We will talk about the contents
of this document in a moment.

If you've used RStudio before, you might have re-arranged the four
panels that you see in the image above, but your version should have the
same general features as in the image above:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A \textbf{document panel} (the top-left panel in the image), which is
  where the document that you're currently \emph{writing} in lives.
\item
  A \textbf{console panel} (The bottom-left panel in the image), which
  is where we can \emph{run} the code that we write.
\item
  An \textbf{environment panel} (the top-right panel in the image),
  which will show the ``objects'' that exist in your R environment. We
  haven't run any code yet, so this is empty.
\item
  The \textbf{files panel} (which is also the \textbf{plot panel} and
  \textbf{viewer panel}), which shows the files in the current local
  ``directory'' (the folder on your computer). When you first open
  RStudio, this is typically your computer's home page.
\end{itemize}

Note that the size of each panel can be changed by dragging the border
between two adjacent panels.

The most important panels at the moment are the \emph{documents} and
\emph{console} panels on the left, so let's take a closer look at these.

\section{Quarto documents}\label{quarto-documents}

The top-left documents panel contains the document that you're currently
working in. There are several types of documents that you could create
in which you could write your R code, but I recommend using \emph{quarto
documents}.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, rightrule=.15mm, toptitle=1mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-note-color}{\faInfo}\hspace{0.5em}{Quarto versus R Markdown}, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, coltitle=black, titlerule=0mm, opacityback=0, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, arc=.35mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, breakable, toprule=.15mm, colback=white]

If you're already familiar with \emph{R Markdown}, \emph{quarto} is just
its modern successor and at first glance, quarto is pretty much the same
as R Markdown, with minor syntactic differences. Don't worry, if you
already have a bunch of old R Markdown documents, there isn't much to be
gained by converting them to quarto files, but I'd recommend that any
\emph{new} files you create be quarto files rather than R Markdown. If
you've never heard of R Markdown, feel free to forget I even mentioned
it.

\end{tcolorbox}

Quarto documents allow you to combine text and code, so that rather than
having your R code be lonely on its own, your code (and its output) can
instead live nestled in between narrative text that describes the
analysis that you're conducting and summarizes the results you obtain.

Quarto documents are mind-blowingly versatile, and while they are mostly
used to create simple html or pdf documents, they can also be used to
make websites (like \href{www.rebeccabarter.com}{mine}) and books (like
this one!)

Whenever I am conducting an analysis using R, I conduct my analysis in a
quarto document. In fact, every chapter in this book is just a quarto
document!

Since we want to practice \emph{reproducible} data science, it is
important that we keep detailed records of the code we wrote that led us
to our data-driven answers. Quarto provides us with an easy way of doing
that. Moreover, because you can surround your code with text narrative,
it can be used to communicate your analysis and results to other people:
quarto lets us feed two birds with one seed!

To start a new quarto document inside RStudio:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Hit the ``New file'' icon, , in the top-left-hand corner of RStudio
  (or \emph{File \textgreater{} New File \textgreater{} Quarto
  Document}) and select ``Quarto document''. The following window should
  pop up:
\end{itemize}

\includegraphics[width=6.13in,height=\textheight]{figures/new_quarto.png}

Then

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Choose a title (e.g., ``An analysis of global life expectancy''), and
  make yourself the author.
\item
  Hit the ``\emph{Create}'' button to create your file.
\end{itemize}

This will open up a new quarto template document in the documents panel.

The template text in your new quarto document contains a very summary of
how quarto documents work. Take a moment to read it.

The regular white-background text is just text like in a Word Document.
The text at the top of the quarto document surrounded by dashes
\texttt{-\/-\/-} is called the \textbf{YAML header}, provides several
parameters and options for your quarto document, such as the title, the
author, and the rendered output format (more on this in a moment).

The grey boxes with \texttt{\{r\}} are called ``code chunks'' and these
are where we will write your R code.

\subsection{Rendering quarto
documents}\label{rendering-quarto-documents}

Note the instructions in the template quarto document ``\emph{When you
click the \textbf{Render} button a document will be generated that
includes both content and the output of embedded code}.'' Take the
document's advice: click the ``Render'' button with a blue arrow, which
is circled in orange below and save your document when prompted as
``analysis.qmd'' or something like that:

\includegraphics[width=10.71in,height=\textheight]{figures/render.png}

Hopefully, what happened when you hit ``Render'' is that some text
appeared very quickly in your bottom-left ``console'' panel and your web
browser opened up with a new (html) webpage with whatever title you
provided that looks something like this:

\includegraphics[width=11.79in,height=\textheight]{figures/render_doc.png}

If you're using RStudio in the cloud (or you have different settings to
me), you may have instead found that the window opened in the ``Viewer''
panel of your RStudio application. If no window opened anywhere,
navigate to the location on your computer where you saved your quarto
document (``analysis.qmd'') and see if a new file ``analysis.html'' has
appeared. If it has, open it in your web browser.

What happened when we hit the ``Render'' button? Hitting ``Render''
renders your \emph{interactive} quarto (analysis.qmd) document as a
\emph{static} HTML (analysis.html) file. This is like saving your
interactive word document file that you can edit as a static pdf file
that you cannot edit.

Compare the original quarto (analysis.qmd) document in RStudio with the
rendered page (analysis.html) in your web browser. What differences do
you notice? Which one can you modify?

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, rightrule=.15mm, toptitle=1mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-tip-color}{\faLightbulb}\hspace{0.5em}{Rendering quarto as PDF and Microsoft Word documents}, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, coltitle=black, titlerule=0mm, opacityback=0, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, arc=.35mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, breakable, toprule=.15mm, colback=white]

By default, quarto documents will be rendered as HTML files, but they
can also be rendered to PDF and Microsoft Word files! You can do this by
changing the \texttt{format:\ html} in the ``\emph{yaml}'' text at the
top of your quarto document (right underneath the ``title'' and
``author'' definitions) to \texttt{format:\ pdf} or
\texttt{format:\ docx}, respectively.

However, note that to render a quarto document to a PDF file, you will
need to have an application called LaTeX installed on your computer (see
the exercise below).

If you switched to \texttt{format:\ pdf}, we recommend switching back to
\texttt{format:\ html} for the rest of this lesson.

\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{``Visual'' mode versus ``Source''
mode}\label{visual-mode-versus-source-mode}

There are currently two modes that your \emph{interactive} quarto
document (i.e., the version in RStudio, not the rendered HTML document)
can be in.

The ``analysis.qmd'' file in ``visual mode'' looks like this:

\includegraphics[width=10.71in,height=\textheight]{figures/visual.png}

If your quarto document is in visual mode, it will be a lot more like a
Word Document, where you will see boldface text, headings, italics,
links, etc.

In this visual mode format, much of the underlying quarto syntax is
hidden from you.

Alternatively, if you view this same ``analysis.qmd'' quarto document in
``Source'' mode, you will be looking at the underlying quarto (markdown)
syntax. The ``analysis.qmd'' file in source mode looks like this:

\includegraphics[width=10.71in,height=\textheight]{figures/source.png}

Notice that there is no boldface text, or headings, etc. Instead there
are raw text symbols to represent these things. For instance,
surrounding text by two asterisks (**) creates boldface text and
preceding some text with pound symbols (\#\#) creates headings (the more
pound symbols used, the more lower-level the heading). This text syntax
is called ``Markdown'' syntax.

Can you identify whether your quarto document is currently in source or
visual mode?

You can toggle your quarto document between source and visual mode using
the ``Source'' and ``Visual'' buttons in the top-left corner of your
quarto document in RStudio.

Whether you prefer source or visual mode will come down to a personal
preference. I personally prefer working with the source mode where I can
see the underlying Markdown syntax that defines the text formatting and
R code chunks, but I know many people who prefer the visual mode.

\subsubsection{Markdown syntax}\label{markdown-syntax}

In case you're interested in learning a little bit more about Markdown
syntax, switch your document over to the ``Source'' mode by hitting
``Source'' in the top left corner of your document.

Re-render your document by hitting the ``Render'' button, and based on
the rendered static html page that will open in your web browser, let's
try to make some sense of the Markdown syntax used in the original
quarto (.qmd) document in RStudio.

Can you see what the \texttt{\#\#} syntax is doing (if you can't see the
\texttt{\#\#} syntax in your quarto document in RStudio, ensure that you
are viewing the quarto document using ``Source'' rather than ``Visual''
in the top-right corner of the document)? The pound symbols are
\textbf{markdown} syntax for creating headers: \texttt{\#} will create a
top-level header (this is the same level as the overall document title),
\texttt{\#\#} will create a level-2 header, \texttt{\#\#\#} will create
a level-3 header, etc.

Notice that the word ``\textbf{Render}'' is shown in bold in the
rendered html file. By looking at the .qmd file, can you figure out what
the markdown syntax is for creating bold-face text?

To learn more about markdown syntax, see
\url{https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/}.

If you want to play around with the Markdown formatting syntax, add some
additional markdown features to your \texttt{analysis.qmd} file (E.g., a
sub-section heading, some italics, or extra bold text), and re-render
your quarto html output by hitting the ``Render'' button. Take note of
how the changes you made were rendered in the static HTML version of
your document.

\section{Where to write your code}\label{where-to-write-your-code}

\subsection{Writing R code in code chunks in a quarto
document}\label{writing-r-code-in-code-chunks-in-a-quarto-document}

I recommend that you write 99\% of your R code in a quarto document,
specifically, your R code should live in the grey boxes with
\texttt{\{r\}}--these are called ``\textbf{code chunks}''.

Hopefully when you were comparing your interactive quarto document with
the rendered HTML document, one difference that you noticed that the
rendered document also showed the ``output'' of the two R code chunks,
which contained the R code \texttt{1\ +\ 1} and \texttt{2\ +\ 2} (the
\emph{output} of these two code chunks were \texttt{2} and \texttt{4},
respectively.)

The image below shows how this interactive code chunk looks in the
quarto document (in source mode):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\InformationTok{\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}\{r\}}
\InformationTok{1 + 1}
\InformationTok{\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Which you can compare with the following image that shows how the static
code chunk looks in the rendered HTML document:

\includegraphics[width=3.72in,height=\textheight]{figures/chunk_html.png}

When a quarto document is rendered into a HTML document, the code in
each of the code chunks is compiled and the result or ``output'' (in
this case the result is \texttt{2}) is printed underneath the chunk.

You can provide ``options'' to code chunks, which are specified with a
point symbol followed by a vertical bar on the first line(s) of the
quarto chunk \texttt{\#\textbar{}}, such as
\texttt{\#\textbar{}\ echo:\ false}, which will tell quarto that it
should hide the R code, but still show the output. So if I have this in
my interactive quarto document in RStudio:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\InformationTok{\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}\{r\}}
\InformationTok{\#| echo: false}
\InformationTok{1 + 1}
\InformationTok{\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

I will only see this in the rendered HTML document (i.e., the
\texttt{1\ +\ 1} code is hidden):

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 2
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Writing and running R code in the
console}\label{writing-and-running-r-code-in-the-console}

Admittedly, it would be really annoying if every time you wanted to see
the output of your code, you had to render the entire quarto document
and look at the output in the HTML document. No one has that much
patience.

Fortunately, you can check the output of your code by running it in the
console panel, which is usually directly underneath your quarto
document.

\includegraphics[width=13.72in,height=\textheight]{figures/console.png}

If you click on the console panel (and scroll down to the bottom), you
should see an arrow \texttt{\textgreater{}} with a blinking cursor
\texttt{\textbar{}} symbol. This means that the console is waiting for
you to type your code.

In your console in RStudio, after the \texttt{\textgreater{}} symbol,
type \texttt{2\ +\ 2} and then hit return (Enter).

Your console should have produced the output/result of your code
(\texttt{4}) underneath, and a new arrow \texttt{\textgreater{}} with a
blinking cursor should have appeared underneath, indicating that R is
ready for some more code like this:

\includegraphics[width=13.71in,height=\textheight]{figures/console_example.png}

So if you can just write your code directly in the console, why bother
with the quarto document at all?

The problem with only ever writing your R code in the R console is that
once you quit RStudio, there will be no record of the code that you ran.

\subsection{Best practices: quarto vs the
console}\label{best-practices-quarto-vs-the-console}

Best practices for writing and saving R code involves writing your code
in R chunks within a quarto document, and then running that code in the
console (and then later rendering your quarto document after you've
written a bunch of code).

This might sound convoluted, but fortunately, you don't have to write
your code in two places. Once you write some code in a code chunk in
your quarto document, you will notice a green ``play'' (right arrow)
button at the right end of the code chunk. If you hit that, you will see
one of two things happen:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Chunk output inline}: The output of your code will appear
  directly underneath your code chunk \emph{inside} your interactive
  quarto document.
\end{enumerate}

\includegraphics[width=10.22in,height=\textheight]{figures/output_inline.png}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Chunk output in console}: Your code be magically transported
  to the console, where it will be automatically run and the output will
  be shown \emph{in the console}.
\end{enumerate}

\includegraphics[width=10.22in,height=\textheight]{figures/output_console.png}

\textbf{There is also a nice keyboard shortcut for running the line of
code on which your cursor is: Command+Enter on a Mac or Ctrl+Enter on
Windows and Linux.}

You can change the settings for where your output appears by selecting
the settings button (circled in the image below) and choosing ``Chunk
output inline'' for the first option or ``chunk output in console'' for
the second option.

\includegraphics[width=10.22in,height=\textheight]{figures/output_options.png}

I strongly prefer the second option of ``chunk output in console'', but
R users are notoriously divided on where they like their output to
appear (inline or in the console).

My suggestion is try both options for a few hours and see which one
sparks joy.

Regardless of where your output appears (inline or in the console), I
strongly suggest that you write all your code in a quarto document
(rather than directly in the console). Writing your code in a quarto
document will save your code and results in a \emph{reproducible} way
AND help you to communicate your findings to other people.

\subsection{Creating new code chunks in
quarto}\label{creating-new-code-chunks-in-quarto}

In a quarto document you can open a new R code chunk by writing three
backticks followed by the letter ``r'' inside some curly parentheses and
you need to ``close'' the code chunk with three backticks. Anything
between these two lines (inside the grey box) is treated as R code, and
anything outside these two lines is regular text.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\InformationTok{\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}\{r\}}


\InformationTok{\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Since it's a pain to type all that every time you want to create a new
code chunk, you can use one of two shortcuts to create a new code chunk:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Hit the ``New Chunk'' button, in RStudio, or
\item
  Use the Option+Command+i keyboard shortcut.
\end{enumerate}

In your quarto document, create three new code chunks, one in each of
the three ways described above. Conduct some basic mathematical
calculations in each code chunk and run the code using any of the
approaches described in the previous section (your output should appear
either inline or in the console, depending on the settings). Then render
your quarto document and look at the html output.

Add a chunk option to hide the code \texttt{\#\textbar{}\ echo:\ false}
to one of your chunks (this echo: false chunk option must go on the
first line of the chunk) and re-run your code (nothing should be
different) and re-render your document and look at the output. What has
changed?

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, rightrule=.15mm, toptitle=1mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-warning-color}{\faExclamationTriangle}\hspace{0.5em}{Common issue: I can't find my rendered document}, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-warning-color!10!white, coltitle=black, titlerule=0mm, opacityback=0, colframe=quarto-callout-warning-color-frame, arc=.35mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, breakable, toprule=.15mm, colback=white]

If you can't find your rendered HTML document, find the location where
you saved your quarto document and find the .html file with the same
name. Open this file in your web browser -- this is your rendered
document. If it doesn't update, when you render your quarto document,
there might be an error in your quarto document (check the ``Background
Jobs'' tab in the console panel to see if there are any error messages).

\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, rightrule=.15mm, toptitle=1mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-warning-color}{\faExclamationTriangle}\hspace{0.5em}{Common issue: I can't run my code}, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-warning-color!10!white, coltitle=black, titlerule=0mm, opacityback=0, colframe=quarto-callout-warning-color-frame, arc=.35mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, breakable, toprule=.15mm, colback=white]

R is very particular about the syntax for the code chunks. There must be
no spaces in front of the backticks that define the code chunk and your
chunk options that start with \texttt{\#\textbar{}} must be on the first
line of the code chunk directly under the backticks and not have any
spaces before it.

If your code shortcuts don't work, start super hard at your code chunk
and see if there is anything wrong!

\chapter{R Fundamentals}\label{r-fundamentals-1}

\section{Doing math with R}\label{doing-math-with-r}

Who needs a calculator, when you have R! For real though, I legitimately
use R as a basic calculator all the time. And while R can do a lot more
than just compute \texttt{1\ +\ 1}, it's worth taking a moment to
discuss the mathematical capabilities of R.

Here are some helpful math symbols:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Parentheses: \texttt{(}, \texttt{)}
\item
  Exponents: \texttt{\^{}} or \texttt{**}
\item
  Multiply: \texttt{*}
\item
  Divide: \texttt{/}
\item
  Add: \texttt{+}
\item
  Subtract: \texttt{-}
\end{itemize}

To follow along with the code examples that I provide in this chapter
(and in this book in general), I recommend creating a new quarto
document and practice writing your own code in code chunks in your
quarto document and running the code in the \emph{console} by either
pressing the green play/arrow button in the top right corner of the code
chunks or using the Command+Return shortcut. Feel free to make some of
your own notes in your quarto document outside. I recommend
compiling/rendering your quarto document every now and then too!

Some basic mathematical computations you can compute in R include power
calculations:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{3} \SpecialCharTok{+} \DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{)}\SpecialCharTok{\^{}}\DecValTok{2}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 64
\end{verbatim}

Division:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DecValTok{2} \SpecialCharTok{/} \DecValTok{7}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 0.2857143
\end{verbatim}

Note that R doesn't really care about spaces, so this is the same as

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DecValTok{2}\SpecialCharTok{/}\DecValTok{7}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 0.2857143
\end{verbatim}

But my recommendation is to always place a single space around
mathematical operators (i.e., \texttt{*}, \texttt{+}, \texttt{-}, etc,
with the exception of the power operator \texttt{\^{}}), so:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DecValTok{2} \SpecialCharTok{+} \DecValTok{1}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 3
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DecValTok{5} \SpecialCharTok{*} \DecValTok{3}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 15
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DecValTok{5}\SpecialCharTok{\^{}}\DecValTok{2}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 25
\end{verbatim}

When writing code, even if the language itself doesn't require certain
syntax like spaces, it is a good idea to choose a syntax \emph{style}
and stick with it.

You can place multiple computations in the same code chunk, like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\InformationTok{\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}\{r\}}
\InformationTok{5 + 109}
\InformationTok{(4 + 2) * 4}
\InformationTok{\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

When a code chunk contains multiple pieces of code, they will all be
computed separately when you compile your document and the output will
look like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DecValTok{5} \SpecialCharTok{+} \DecValTok{109}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 114
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{4} \SpecialCharTok{+} \DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{) }\SpecialCharTok{*} \DecValTok{4}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 24
\end{verbatim}

\section{Code comments}\label{code-comments}

When you have multiple pieces of code in a single code chunk (or even a
single piece of code), it is recommended that you use code comments to
explain what your code is doing. Since R treats everything inside a code
chunk as code, if you want to write some text comments inside a code
chunk, you can tell R that your text is not code by placing a
\texttt{\#} symbol at the beginning of your text like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# compute 4 times 5}
\DecValTok{4} \SpecialCharTok{*} \DecValTok{5}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 20
\end{verbatim}

R will ignore anything that follows a \texttt{\#} symbol. So in the
above code chunk, R will ignore the first line with the code comment
``compute 4 times 5'', and then it will compute the R code on the next
line, \texttt{4\ *\ 5}.

Code comments are really helpful for explaining what your code is doing.
I usually reserve the text outside code chunks for more general
discussion of my data, analysis, and results and I reserve code comments
inside code chunks for explaining my code itself. I tend to forget the
reasons behind certain decisions I made in my code, but adding
explanations in code comments helps me remember my motivations and
intentions days, months, or even years later.

\section{Scientific notation}\label{scientific-notation}

When doing mathematical calculations in R, very quickly you are going to
start encountering some very strange looking output. For example, if I
compute

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DecValTok{1} \SpecialCharTok{/} \DecValTok{70000}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 1.428571e-05
\end{verbatim}

or

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DecValTok{12}\SpecialCharTok{\^{}}\DecValTok{15}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 1.540702e+16
\end{verbatim}

You can see that my output looks a little strange.

When a number is very big or very small, R gets lazy and decides that it
doesn't want to print all of its digits. Rather than just making up
random numbers, R is printing these numbers in scientific notation.
\texttt{2e-05} means ``0.00002'', i.e., there is a 2 in the 5th decimal
place. On the other hand, \texttt{2e+05} (with a \texttt{+} instead of
\texttt{-}), corresponds to 200000, i.e., ``2'' with 5 0's after it.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, rightrule=.15mm, toptitle=1mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-tip-color}{\faLightbulb}\hspace{0.5em}{No commas allowed!}, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, coltitle=black, titlerule=0mm, opacityback=0, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, arc=.35mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, breakable, toprule=.15mm, colback=white]

Note that R doesn't allow for commas in numbers. If you want to write a
large number, you have to remove the comma:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# this is fine}
\DecValTok{70000}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 70000
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# this is not fine {-}{-} note the "error" message}
\DecValTok{70}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{000}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Error: <text>:1:3: unexpected ','
1: 70,
      ^
\end{verbatim}

\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Mathematical functions}\label{mathematical-functions}

While being able to do addition, subtraction, and multiplication is
super awesome, sometimes you will need to use more complex mathematical
operations in your computations, such as the logarithm, exponential, and
square-root. Fortunately there are \textbf{functions} in R that let you
compute these operations.

A function is a piece of R code that is referenced using alias or a
name. A function typically takes an ``argument'', such as a number, and
it does something to the argument, such as compute the logarithm, and
then it returns the result.

To apply a function to a value, you write the name of the function
(e.g., \texttt{log}), followed by some parentheses \texttt{()}, inside
which you provide the argument or value that you want to apply the
function to, as in: \texttt{log(2)}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# compute the square root of 2}
\FunctionTok{sqrt}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 1.414214
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# compute the log of 2}
\FunctionTok{log}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 0.6931472
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# compute e\^{}2}
\FunctionTok{exp}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 7.389056
\end{verbatim}

\section{Defining variables}\label{defining-variables}

One of the main features of coding in R is defining ``objects'' or
``variables'' (I use these terms interchangeably). Creating a variable
essentially involves giving a value a name, allowing you to reference
that value later. When we are ready to load some actual data, we will
give that data a name by storing it in a variable.

Let's store the value \texttt{1} in a variable called
\texttt{my\_variable} using the \textbf{assignment operator}:
\texttt{my\_variable\ \textless{}-\ 1}. Think of the assignment operator
\texttt{\textless{}-} as an arrow, pointing from the value on the right
to the variable name on the left.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{my\_variable }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \DecValTok{1} 
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note that when you define a variable, no output is shown.

You can view the value of \texttt{my\_variable} by writing it's name:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{my\_variable}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 1
\end{verbatim}

You can think of \texttt{my\_variable} as an alias for the value
\texttt{1}. This means that anything that I could do to the value
\texttt{1}, I can now do to \texttt{my\_variable}, such as adding
\texttt{2} to it:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{my\_variable }\SpecialCharTok{+} \DecValTok{2}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 3
\end{verbatim}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, rightrule=.15mm, toptitle=1mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-tip-color}{\faLightbulb}\hspace{0.5em}{R is case sensitive}, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, coltitle=black, titlerule=0mm, opacityback=0, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, arc=.35mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, breakable, toprule=.15mm, colback=white]

R is case sensitive, which means that I must write my variable name
exactly as it is written. For example, the following will yield an
error:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{my\_Variable}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'my_Variable' not found
\end{verbatim}

because the variable is called \texttt{my\_variable}, not
\texttt{my\_Variable}.

\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, rightrule=.15mm, toptitle=1mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-tip-color}{\faLightbulb}\hspace{0.5em}{Defining variables using \texttt{=}}, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, coltitle=black, titlerule=0mm, opacityback=0, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, arc=.35mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, breakable, toprule=.15mm, colback=white]

Another way to define a variable is using ``=''.

Below, I create \texttt{another\_variable}, assign it the value
\texttt{3}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{another\_variable }\OtherTok{=} \DecValTok{3}
\NormalTok{another\_variable }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 3
\end{verbatim}

But convention in the R community prefers the use of the
\texttt{\textless{}-} assignment operator over the \texttt{=} assignment
operator. So while, \texttt{=} will work just fine, it is a lot less
common among seasoned R programmers.

\end{tcolorbox}

Whenever we do a mathematical calculations using numeric values, we
create a new numeric value, for example, the computation

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DecValTok{1} \SpecialCharTok{+} \DecValTok{1}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 2
\end{verbatim}

creates the value \texttt{2}.

You can also assign the \emph{output} of mathematical calculations to a
variable.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# assign the output of 1 + 1 to the variable one\_plus\_one}
\NormalTok{one\_plus\_one }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \DecValTok{1} \SpecialCharTok{+} \DecValTok{1}
\NormalTok{one\_plus\_one}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 2
\end{verbatim}

It is important to make the distinction that \texttt{one\_plus\_one}
does not contain the mathematical \emph{equation} \texttt{1\ +\ 1}.
Instead, it contains the numerical value, \texttt{2}, which is the
\emph{output} of the equation \texttt{1\ +\ 1}.

\texttt{one\_plus\_one} doesn't remember that it was created by
computing \texttt{1\ +\ 1}, it just knows that the value it contains is
\texttt{2}.

\section{Exercise}

Define a new object \texttt{prod} that contains the output of the
product of 5 and 2. Print out \texttt{prod} by writing its name

\section{Solution}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{prod }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \DecValTok{5} \SpecialCharTok{*} \DecValTok{2}
\NormalTok{prod}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 10
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Overwriting variables}\label{overwriting-variables}

Below I define \texttt{my\_number} to be a variable containing the
numeric value \texttt{5}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{my\_number }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \DecValTok{5}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Next, I define a new variable called \texttt{result}, that contains the
product of \texttt{my\_number} and \texttt{7}, and I print it out:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{result }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ my\_number }\SpecialCharTok{*} \DecValTok{7}
\NormalTok{result}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 35
\end{verbatim}

Here, \texttt{result} is defined based on the value of
\texttt{my\_number}.

What do you think would happen to \texttt{result} if I redefine
\texttt{my\_number} to now contain \texttt{8}?

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# update the value of my\_number to be 8}
\NormalTok{my\_number }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \DecValTok{8}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Do you think \texttt{result} will have changed? Try it yourself in
RStudio or click the ``Answer'' tab below.

\section{Question}

What happens to \texttt{result}?

\section{Answer}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# define result using \textasciigrave{}my\_number\textasciigrave{}}
\NormalTok{result }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ my\_number }\SpecialCharTok{*} \DecValTok{7}
\NormalTok{result}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 56
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# modify my\_number}
\NormalTok{my\_number }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \DecValTok{8}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Result does not change.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{result}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 56
\end{verbatim}

When we defined \texttt{result\ \textless{}-\ my\_number\ *\ 7}, we
assigned result to the \emph{output} of \texttt{my\_number\ *\ 7}, which
is \texttt{56}.

Once it has been defined, \texttt{result} forgets all about
\texttt{my\_number}, it just remembers the value \texttt{56}.

This means that changing \texttt{my\_number} \emph{after} having defined
\texttt{result} will have no effect on \texttt{result}. There is no link
between the two variables, despite the fact that \texttt{result} was
originally defined using \texttt{my\_number}!

\section{Exercise}

Without running the code below, guess what the output/result will be:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{value }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \DecValTok{1}
\NormalTok{computed\_result }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ value }\SpecialCharTok{*} \DecValTok{10} \SpecialCharTok{+} \DecValTok{3}\SpecialCharTok{\^{}}\DecValTok{2}
\NormalTok{value }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ value }\SpecialCharTok{+} \DecValTok{2}
\NormalTok{computed\_result }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\section{Solution}

Note that the first three lines of code all involve defining variables
and so no output is shown when these are run. The final line of code
will print out the value of \texttt{computed\_result}.

The second line
\texttt{computed\_result\ \textless{}-\ value\ *\ 10\ +\ 3\^{}2} defines
\texttt{computed\_result} using \texttt{value}. Then the third line
\texttt{value\ \textless{}-\ value\ +\ 2} updates value. Since
\texttt{computed\_result} is assigned to the \emph{output} of
\texttt{value\ *\ 10\ +\ 3\^{}2}, which is \texttt{19}, it doesn't care
when \texttt{value} is subsequently updated, and so the
\texttt{computed\_result} is still just equal to \texttt{19}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{value }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \DecValTok{1}
\NormalTok{computed\_result }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ value }\SpecialCharTok{*} \DecValTok{10} \SpecialCharTok{+} \DecValTok{3}\SpecialCharTok{\^{}}\DecValTok{2}
\NormalTok{value }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ value }\SpecialCharTok{+} \DecValTok{2}
\NormalTok{computed\_result }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 19
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Variable names}\label{variable-names}

While you can give your variables \emph{almost} any name you like, there
are a few rules that you need follow.

While variable names can contain letters, numbers, underscores, and
periods, recommended convention specifies that variable names should
contain purely \textbf{lowercase letters and numbers, with words
separated by underscores}.

For example, \texttt{var\_name} and \texttt{my\_var} are considered
``good'' variable names, whereas \texttt{varName}, \texttt{VarName}, and
\texttt{var.name} are not.

Note that variable names cannot \emph{begin} with numbers or
underscores. If you try to create variables whose names are illegal, you
will get an error, such as:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{plus1 }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \DecValTok{1} \SpecialCharTok{+} \DecValTok{1}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Error: <text>:1:2: unexpected symbol
1: 1plus1
     ^
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{\_var }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \DecValTok{1} \SpecialCharTok{+} \DecValTok{1}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Error: <text>:1:2: unexpected symbol
1: _var
     ^
\end{verbatim}

\section{Exercise}

Which of the following are valid R variable names? Which ones are
\emph{good} variable names?

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{min\_height}
\NormalTok{max.height}
\NormalTok{\_age}
\NormalTok{MaxLength}
\NormalTok{min}\SpecialCharTok{{-}}\NormalTok{length}
\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{widths}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\section{Solution}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{min\_height}: this is a \textbf{good} variable name
\item
  \texttt{max.height}: this is a \textbf{valid} variable name, but not
  necessarily a ``good'' variable name (words should be separated with
  \texttt{\_}, not \texttt{.})
\item
  \texttt{\_age}: this is \textbf{not a valid} variable name (variable
  names cannot start with \texttt{\_})
\item
  \texttt{MaxLength}: this is a \textbf{valid} variable name, but not
  necessarily a ``good'' variable name (words should be lowercase and
  separated with underscores)
\item
  \texttt{min-length}: this is \textbf{not a valid} variable name (words
  should be separated with \texttt{\_}, not the minus sign \texttt{-})
\item
  \texttt{2widths}: this is \textbf{not a valid} variable name (variable
  names cannot start with numbers)
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Types}\label{types}

\section{Common object types}\label{common-object-types}

So far, we have only worked with numbers in R. But there are many other
kinds of values that you will encounter in your R journeys.

The main types of values that you'll encounter in R are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Numeric}: numbers, e.g., \texttt{1}, \texttt{3.5},
  \texttt{1e5} (which is scientific notation for 100,000)
\item
  \textbf{Character}: free-form text values, e.g.,
  \texttt{"California"}, \texttt{"John\ Doe"}, \texttt{"XJ1784"}
\item
  \textbf{Logical} (Boolean): binary values corresponding to
  \texttt{TRUE} and \texttt{FALSE}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Numeric values}\label{numeric-values}

You can use the \texttt{class()} function to ask what type of object a
value is. For example, the class of \texttt{9.6} is ``numeric''

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{class}\NormalTok{(}\FloatTok{9.6}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "numeric"
\end{verbatim}

So is the class of \texttt{-5}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{class}\NormalTok{(}\SpecialCharTok{{-}}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "numeric"
\end{verbatim}

and \texttt{1e7} (which is scientific notation for 10,000,000)

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{class}\NormalTok{(}\FloatTok{1e7}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "numeric"
\end{verbatim}

You can also use the \texttt{class()} function to ask the class of the
value stored in a \emph{variable}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{y }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \DecValTok{2} \SpecialCharTok{*} \DecValTok{3} \SpecialCharTok{+} \DecValTok{1}
\NormalTok{y}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 7
\end{verbatim}

Identify the class of \texttt{y} (which contains the value \texttt{7}):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{class}\NormalTok{(y)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "numeric"
\end{verbatim}

If your object has class \texttt{"numeric"}, you can do mathematical
computations with it:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{y }\SpecialCharTok{+} \DecValTok{2}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 9
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{y}\SpecialCharTok{\^{}}\DecValTok{3}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 343
\end{verbatim}

\section{Exercise}

Identify the class (type) of the value \texttt{99.9}

\section{Solution}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{class}\NormalTok{(}\FloatTok{99.9}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "numeric"
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Character values}\label{character-values}

Many datasets will contain text as well as numbers! In R, text has a
``character'' type.

The following contain examples of character type values:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\StringTok{"banana"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "banana"
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\StringTok{"I really like owls"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "I really like owls"
\end{verbatim}

And like numbers, you can save character type values in a variable:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{char\_var }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \StringTok{"my first character variable"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

And to view the contents of our character variable, you just type its
name as usual:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{char\_var}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "my first character variable"
\end{verbatim}

And I can ask what class it has using the class function:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{class}\NormalTok{(char\_var)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "character"
\end{verbatim}

What is the difference between a variable name and a character value?
\textbf{Character values are always surrounded by quotes}, whereas
variable names are not.

So if I try to type \texttt{banana} into my R console without the
quotes, R will think I am referring to a variable name called
\texttt{banana} and I will get a mildly rude error because I haven't
defined any variables called \texttt{banana}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{banana}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'banana' not found
\end{verbatim}

The
\texttt{object\ \textquotesingle{}banana\textquotesingle{}\ not\ found}
means that I've accidentally referred to a variable in my code
(\texttt{banana}, in this case) that doesn't exist because I haven't
defined it!

\section{Question}

What will be the class of the following variable that contains the value
\texttt{"1"} with quotes (as opposed to \texttt{1} without quotes)?

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{var\_one }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \StringTok{"1"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\section{Solution}

It's a character value

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{class}\NormalTok{(var\_one)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "character"
\end{verbatim}

Note the quotes when I print out the variable:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{var\_one}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "1"
\end{verbatim}

Does the answer to the question above surprise you? Remember, that
whenever a value is surrounded by quotes, it is a character. It doesn't
matter whether the value contains a number or not!

\subsubsection{Mathematical computations with character
values}\label{mathematical-computations-with-character-values}

What do you think will happen when you try to do mathematical operations
with character (text) variables?

Let's define a character variable and try to add the number \texttt{1}
to it:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# define a character variable}
\NormalTok{char }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \StringTok{"hello"}
\CommentTok{\# try to add 1 to it}
\NormalTok{char }\SpecialCharTok{+} \DecValTok{1}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Error in char + 1: non-numeric argument to binary operator
\end{verbatim}

This
\texttt{Error\ in\ char\ +\ 1\ :\ non-numeric\ argument\ to\ binary\ operator}
error will become very familiar to you in time. This error is a very
unhelpful way that R tells us that we \emph{cannot do mathematical
operations with non-numeric (e.g., character) values}. Bummer.

So if we can't do math with character values, what's the point of them?

The purpose of character values is to store categorical and text
information, which we will often use to do things like creating groups
in our data (e.g., separating people according to the state in which
they live).

\subsection{Logical values}\label{logical-values}

Let's move onto ``logical'' or ``Boolean'' type values. These are fairly
simple because there is only two of them: \texttt{TRUE} and
\texttt{FALSE}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ConstantTok{TRUE}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] TRUE
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ConstantTok{FALSE}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] FALSE
\end{verbatim}

For your logical value to be recognized as a logical value it must be in
all caps. As if you're yelling (LIKE THIS). If you don't yell loud
enough, R will complain. For instance, if I only yell the first letter,
like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{True}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'True' not found
\end{verbatim}

R says
\texttt{Error:\ object\ \textquotesingle{}True\textquotesingle{}\ not\ found},
which, if you were paying attention earlier, is code for ``there is no
\emph{variable} named \texttt{True}. R is trying to find a variable
called \texttt{True} and it's failing to do so which is
unsurprising\ldots{} because you haven't defined one! It doesn't know
you're trying to use a logical \texttt{TRUE} value, because you didn't
use all caps (i.e, you weren't yelling loudly enough).

As with everything else, we can use \texttt{class()} to ask the class of
logical values, and unsurprisingly, it tells us that the class of
logical values are ``logical'':

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{class}\NormalTok{(}\ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "logical"
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{class}\NormalTok{(}\ConstantTok{FALSE}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "logical"
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{logical\_var }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \ConstantTok{TRUE}
\FunctionTok{class}\NormalTok{(logical\_var)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "logical"
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Mathematical computations with logical
values}\label{mathematical-computations-with-logical-values}

What do you think will happen when we try to do mathematical operations
with logical values? Let's try:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# Try to subtract 3 from logical\_var}
\NormalTok{logical\_var }\SpecialCharTok{{-}} \DecValTok{3}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] -2
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# Try to add 0.2 to FALSE}
\ConstantTok{FALSE} \SpecialCharTok{+} \FloatTok{0.2}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 0.2
\end{verbatim}

Interestingly, it seems to work (unlike when we tried to do mathematical
operations with character values)\ldots{} But what is it doing?

If you could choose any numbers to convert \texttt{TRUE} and
\texttt{FALSE} to, what would you choose? I would probably choose
\texttt{TRUE} to be \texttt{1} and \texttt{FALSE} to be \texttt{0}.
Fortunately for me, this is exactly what R does.

When they are involved in mathematical operations, logical values are
converted to their numeric binary counterpart values of \texttt{0}
(\texttt{FALSE}) and \texttt{1} (\texttt{TRUE}).

If you replaced \texttt{logical\_var} (which contains \texttt{TRUE})
with \texttt{1} and \texttt{FALSE} with \texttt{0} in the code chunk
above, does the output make sense now?

\section{Exercise}

Before you run the following code, predict which of the following four
computations will work and what will their output be?

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\StringTok{"TRUE"} \SpecialCharTok{*} \DecValTok{4}
\StringTok{"banana"} \SpecialCharTok{+} \StringTok{"apple"}
\ConstantTok{FALSE} \SpecialCharTok{+} \DecValTok{5}
\ConstantTok{TRUE} \SpecialCharTok{+} \StringTok{"TRUE"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\section{Solution}

Only the third computation is valid.

The first computation doesn't work because \texttt{"TRUE"} is a
character type (since it is surrounded by quotes) and you can't add
characters and numbers.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\StringTok{"TRUE"} \SpecialCharTok{*} \DecValTok{4}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Error in "TRUE" * 4: non-numeric argument to binary operator
\end{verbatim}

The second computation doesn't work because you can't add character
values to one another.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\StringTok{"banana"} \SpecialCharTok{+} \StringTok{"apple"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Error in "banana" + "apple": non-numeric argument to binary operator
\end{verbatim}

This third computation does work because when used in a mathematical
operation, the Boolean/logical value \texttt{FALSE} is treated as 0

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ConstantTok{FALSE} \SpecialCharTok{+} \DecValTok{5}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 5
\end{verbatim}

The fourth computation doesn't work because \texttt{"TRUE"} is a
character type (since it is surrounded by quotes) and you can't add
characters to anything, including logical values.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ConstantTok{TRUE} \SpecialCharTok{+} \StringTok{"TRUE"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Error in TRUE + "TRUE": non-numeric argument to binary operator
\end{verbatim}

\section{Type conversions}\label{type-conversions}

Let's define a numeric variable.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{numeric\_var }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FloatTok{12.5}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

What if I told you that I could convert this numeric variable to another
type? You'd probably say ``\emph{Wow, really}?!''

Let's try to convert the numeric object to a character type using the
\texttt{as.character()} function. As you may have guessed,
\texttt{as.character()} tries to convert whatever object given inside
its parentheses (i.e., its ``argument'') to a character type.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# apply as.character() to numeric\_var}
\FunctionTok{as.character}\NormalTok{(numeric\_var)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "12.5"
\end{verbatim}

Did it work? Notice that the 12.5 has some quotes around it now. That
means that it's not a numeric value anymore. It's now a \emph{text}
(character) value that contains a number. This means that you can't do
math with it. I'm a rebel though, so I'm going to try anyway:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{as.character}\NormalTok{(numeric\_var) }\SpecialCharTok{*} \DecValTok{5}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Error in as.character(numeric_var) * 5: non-numeric argument to binary operator
\end{verbatim}

Dang. Well I guess this should have been expected since the output
(result) of \texttt{as.character()} is probably going to be a
character\ldots{} I can apply the \texttt{class()} function to the
character value created by \texttt{as.character(numeric\_var)} by
placing \texttt{as.character(numeric\_var)} inside the \texttt{class()}
parentheses:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{class}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{as.character}\NormalTok{(numeric\_var))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "character"
\end{verbatim}

This code is ``nesting'' the \texttt{class()} and
\texttt{as.character()} functions.

Do you think that running the \texttt{as.character(numeric\_var)} code
has \emph{modified} the original \texttt{numeric\_var} object at all
(i.e., does using \texttt{as.character()} on a variable actually convert
that variable to a character type\ldots{} or does it just print out the
character type version of the variable)?

You can check by just outputting the \texttt{numeric\_var} object by
typing its name:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{numeric\_var}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 12.5
\end{verbatim}

Notice there are no quotes, so it's still a numeric-type object. We can
also confirm this using the class function:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{class}\NormalTok{(numeric\_var)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "numeric"
\end{verbatim}

If we wanted to update the \texttt{numeric\_var} object so that it had a
character type, we would need to ``reassign'' it to the output of
\texttt{as.character(numeric\_var)}. This would overwrite the old
\texttt{numeric\_var} and replace it with the new character version. I
don't want to do this though, so I'm not going to run this code.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# To overwrite numeric\_var with a character version, run:}
\NormalTok{numeric\_var }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{as.character}\NormalTok{(numeric\_var)}
\NormalTok{numeric\_var}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "12.5"
\end{verbatim}

Just as there is an \texttt{as.character()} function, there is also an
\texttt{as.numeric()} function (there's also an \texttt{as.logical()}
function, but I don't think I've ever actually had used it)

Rather than bore you to bits by outlining all of the possible
conversions you can do with \texttt{as.numeric()} and
\texttt{as.character()}, I'm going to make you do it for me. Use the
\texttt{as.numeric()} and \texttt{as.character()} functions to fill in
the following table (I've already filled in the first row for you!):

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule\noalign{}
\texttt{value} & Original type & \texttt{as.character(value)} &
\texttt{as.numeric(value)} \\
\midrule\noalign{}
\endhead
\bottomrule\noalign{}
\endlastfoot
\texttt{12.5} & numeric & \texttt{"12.5"} & \texttt{12.5} \\
\texttt{TRUE} & logical & & \\
\texttt{FALSE} & logical & & \\
\texttt{"howdy"} & character & & \\
\texttt{"99"} & character & & \\
\texttt{"1,200"} & character & & \\
\end{longtable}

Pay close attention to which \texttt{value} entries have quotes and
which values do not.

Did any of these results surprise you?

When you run \texttt{as.numeric("howdy")} or
\texttt{as.numeric("1,200")}, you should get an \texttt{NA} value, which
is a \emph{missing value}, along with a warning:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{as.numeric}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"howdy"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Warning: NAs introduced by coercion
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] NA
\end{verbatim}

Unlike an error, which means that your code did not actually run, when
you get a \emph{warning}, your code has run, but R is telling you it's
not happy with you. When you get a warning, it's a good idea to take a
pause and consider that perhaps your code may not have done what you
expected.

The warning here, \texttt{NAs\ introduced\ by\ coercion} happens when
you try to convert characters to numbers. \textbf{Characters cannot be
converted to numbers}, unless the character contains a number without
any additional characters, as you should have seen when filling in your
table above.

This means that this works:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{as.numeric}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"99"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 99
\end{verbatim}

But this does not:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{as.numeric}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"1,200"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Warning: NAs introduced by coercion
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] NA
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{1,200} may look like a number, but the presence of the comma
\texttt{,} means that R cannot parse the number inside the quotes. R is
a bit dumb sometimes. What is obvious to us is not always obvious to our
computer overlords.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, rightrule=.15mm, toptitle=1mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-tip-color}{\faLightbulb}\hspace{0.5em}{Extracting numeric values from characters}, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, coltitle=black, titlerule=0mm, opacityback=0, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, arc=.35mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, breakable, toprule=.15mm, colback=white]

If you do want to convert a character containing a number, such as
\texttt{"1,200"} to a numeric type, you can use the
\texttt{parse\_number()} function from the ``readr'' R library. You'll
learn more about libraries in future chapters, so don't worry about
running this code now--I just wanted to let you know that this exists!

\begin{Shaded}

\section{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{NA}
values}{NA values}}\label{na-values}

Let's talk briefly about the \texttt{NA} value (missing values). They
are everywhere. You will often find that once they make their way into
your data in R, missing values have a way of permeating your existence.

A missing value, \texttt{NA}, is a special type of object. Like
\texttt{TRUE} and \texttt{FALSE}, your \texttt{NA} must be in all caps
(i.e., you must yell when you type it).

For example, this is the NA value:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ConstantTok{NA}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] NA
\end{verbatim}

But R thinks that the lowercase version, \texttt{na}, is a variable (and
R then complains when I type \texttt{na} because I haven't defined a
variable called \texttt{na}):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{na}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'na' not found
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{NA} values are annoying, because the result of any mathematical
operation with an \texttt{NA} is always \texttt{NA}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ConstantTok{NA} \SpecialCharTok{+} \DecValTok{5}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] NA
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ConstantTok{NA} \SpecialCharTok{*} \DecValTok{0}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] NA
\end{verbatim}

Armed with the knowledge that character values will be converted to
\texttt{NA} when you apply \texttt{as.numeric()}, but numeric values can
be converted to character values using \texttt{as.character()} just
fine, try the following exercise.

\section{Asking questions with logical
operations}\label{asking-questions-with-logical-operations}

Let's go ahead and create two band-new numeric variables. And because I
lack originality, I'll just call them \texttt{x} and \texttt{y}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \DecValTok{2}
\NormalTok{y }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \DecValTok{4}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

I'm now going to ask R some questions about \texttt{x} and \texttt{y}.

First question: \emph{``Is x equal to 2?''}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x }\SpecialCharTok{==} \DecValTok{2}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] TRUE
\end{verbatim}

R answered is ``Yes!'' But in R-speak, ``Yes!'' is \texttt{TRUE}.

To ask a question of equality, we used two equals symbols \texttt{==}.

Next question: \emph{``Is \texttt{x} less than or equal to
\texttt{1}?''}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x }\SpecialCharTok{\textless{}=} \DecValTok{1}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] FALSE
\end{verbatim}

Again, R came through with an answer (this time \texttt{FALSE}). To ask
a question of ``less than or equal to'', we used a ``less than'' symbol
\texttt{\textless{}} followed by an equals symbols \texttt{=}, giving me
\texttt{\textless{}=}.

Although both \texttt{==} and \texttt{\textless{}=} kind of look like
the assignment operators \texttt{=} and \texttt{\textless{}-}, they're
not affiliated in any way.

\texttt{==} and \texttt{\textless{}=} are ``question asking'' operators,
or ``\emph{logical operators}'' if you want to sound fancy (they're
called ``logical operators'' because they always result in a
\texttt{TRUE} or \texttt{FALSE} logical result).

Before we asked if \texttt{x} was equal to \texttt{2}
(\texttt{x\ ==\ 2}), but we can also ask whether \texttt{x} is equal to
\texttt{y}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x }\SpecialCharTok{==}\NormalTok{ y}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] FALSE
\end{verbatim}

As well as ``is \texttt{x} \emph{not} equal to y'' using the ``not equal
to'' logical question operator of an exclamation point followed by an
equals symbol \texttt{!=} (not equals):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x }\SpecialCharTok{!=}\NormalTok{ y}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] TRUE
\end{verbatim}

In fact, for any logical question we ask, we can ask it's \emph{inverse}
by placing the original question in parentheses and prefacing with a
\texttt{!}. So the following is another way to ask \texttt{x\ !=\ y}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\SpecialCharTok{!}\NormalTok{(x }\SpecialCharTok{==}\NormalTok{ y)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] TRUE
\end{verbatim}

Here are some more questions:

``Is \texttt{x} strictly greater than \texttt{y}?''

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x }\SpecialCharTok{\textgreater{}}\NormalTok{ y}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] FALSE
\end{verbatim}

``Is \texttt{x} greater than or equal to \texttt{y}?''

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x }\SpecialCharTok{\textgreater{}=}\NormalTok{ y}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] FALSE
\end{verbatim}

``Is \texttt{x} strictly less than \texttt{y}?''

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x }\SpecialCharTok{\textless{}}\NormalTok{ y}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] TRUE
\end{verbatim}

Cool stuff. It's almost like we're talking to R and it's
\emph{replying!} Hint: this is going to be really important in a little
while, so I hope you're paying attention.

\chapter{Vectors}\label{vectors}

\section{Defining a vector}\label{defining-a-vector}

While being able to store numbers and text in a variable, such as
\texttt{x\ \textless{}-\ 12}, is super neat, the real power of variables
is being able to store a wide variety of objects, including an entire
dataset, model, or even a data visualization!

However, before we try to create an object containing an entire dataset,
let's start with a variable that contains just a collection of values,
such as might appear in a single column of a dataset.

The kind of object that contains a collection of values is called a
\textbf{vector}. Let's create a vector that contains the ages of 5
people and store it in a variable called \texttt{age}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{12}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{19}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{22}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{35}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{18}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Just like our variables in the previous chapters, we can look at the
contents of \texttt{age} by typing its name:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 12 19 22 35 18
\end{verbatim}

But unlike our previous variables, \texttt{age} contains many values,
and this is because \texttt{age} is a vector, which is defined by
``concatenating'' values together using the \texttt{c()} function.

Note that the \texttt{{[}1{]}} at the beginning of the output is just
telling you that the first value is at location 1. If our vector was so
long that it would spill onto multiple lines in our output, such as the
vector below, notice that the second line in the has a different number
inside the square parentheses. This is just telling you which entry (in
terms of its position in the vector) the first entry on the second line
is.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{long\_age }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{12}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{19}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{22}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{35}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{18}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{44}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{23}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{56}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{23}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{12}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{18}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{19}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{50}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{60}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{77}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{54}\NormalTok{, }
              \DecValTok{34}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{66}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{34}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{32}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{19}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{20}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{21}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{18}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{19}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{72}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{27}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{43}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{63}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{23}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{12}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{18}\NormalTok{, }
              \DecValTok{19}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{50}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{60}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{77}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{54}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{long\_age}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
 [1] 12 19 22 35 18 44 23 56 23 12 18 19 50 60 77 54 34 66 34 32 19 20 21 18 19
[26] 72 27 43 63 23 12 18 19 50 60 77 54
\end{verbatim}

Notice that the second line in the ``output'' has a different number
inside the square parentheses. This is just telling you which entry (in
terms of its index position) that first entry on the second line is.

The \texttt{c()} function asks R to place all of the values provided
inside the parentheses of \texttt{c()}, which are separated by commas,
into a single vector object.

You might think that when we apply \texttt{class()} to our \texttt{age}
vector object, that it would return ``vector''. However, the \emph{type}
or \emph{class} of a vector is actually just the \emph{type} or
\emph{class} of the values it contains, which in this case, is
``numeric''

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{class}\NormalTok{(age)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "numeric"
\end{verbatim}

This means that if we had created a vector of names, such as the one
below:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{names }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"Dean"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Xiao"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Sara"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Ravi"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Maya"}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{names}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "Dean" "Xiao" "Sara" "Ravi" "Maya"
\end{verbatim}

Then our \texttt{names} vector object will have class ``character'':

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{class}\NormalTok{(names)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "character"
\end{verbatim}

Vectors are great. Rather than having to carry around all of my
individual numbers and words individually, I can put them all into a
little vector ``bag'' and carry them around together.

However, vectors are a little bit particular. Let's try and create a
vector that contains multiple different types of values, such as numbers
and text:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{multi\_vec }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{9}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"banana"}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{, }\SpecialCharTok{{-}}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{multi\_vec}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "1"      "9"      "banana" "10"     "-1"    
\end{verbatim}

What class/type do you think this \texttt{multi\_vec} vector will have?
Take a close look at the values in the \texttt{multi\_vec} output above.
Notice the quotes around the numbers. Let's check the class of
\texttt{multi\_vec}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{class}\NormalTok{(multi\_vec)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "character"
\end{verbatim}

Interesting. \texttt{multi\_vec} is a character vector, despite the fact
that most of the values used to create it were numbers.

This is because \textbf{vectors can only contain values of a single
type}.

R will let you create a vector using values of multiple different types
(such as numbers and characters), but in the actual vector object that
is created, all of the values will be \emph{converted} to the same type,
in this example, that type was ``character''.

What do you think will happen if we try to create a vector with numeric
and logical values (\texttt{TRUE}/\texttt{FALSE}) values? Below I try to
combine some numbers with a \texttt{TRUE} and a \texttt{FALSE} into the
same vector.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{multi\_vec2 }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{, }\ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{, }\ConstantTok{FALSE}\NormalTok{, }\SpecialCharTok{{-}}\DecValTok{9}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Notice how the output when I print the name of the object differs from
the object I defined above:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{multi\_vec2}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1]  1  5  1  0 -9
\end{verbatim}

What has happened here? Just like R converted my numbers to a character
when a character value was present in the vector, here, R has converted
my logical values (my \texttt{TRUE} and \texttt{FALSE} values) to
numbers (corresponding to \texttt{1} and \texttt{0}, respectively).

How can you tell what type a vector will have when it is created using
values of various different types? It turns out that there is a
hierarchy of types:

\textbf{Character \textgreater{} Numeric \textgreater{} Logical}

This doesn't mean that characters are better than numerics and logicals,
but rather this means that if a character value is present among the
values that define the vector, then all values in the vector will be
converted to the character type. If there are no characters being used
to define the vector, but there are numeric values and logical values,
then all of the values will be converted to the numeric type.

\section{Exercise}

Before you run the code below, predict what vector will be created from
the code below. Consider the type hierarchy above.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{vector\_example }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"hello"}\NormalTok{, }\ConstantTok{FALSE}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\section{Solution}

Since the vector definition includes a character value, all values in
the resulting vector have a character type (notice the quotes)

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{vector\_example }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"hello"}\NormalTok{, }\ConstantTok{FALSE}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{vector\_example}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "TRUE"  "4"     "hello" "FALSE" "0"    
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{class}\NormalTok{(vector\_example)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "character"
\end{verbatim}

\section{Working with vectors:
vectorization}\label{working-with-vectors-vectorization}

While it's super neat that we can collect all of our numbers and words
in a single vector object (although with no mixing of words and
numbers), the actual cool thing about vectors is that it makes it really
easy to do computations on all of our values at once.

If we define our \texttt{age} vector below:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{12}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{18}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{22}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{21}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{17}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

then we can demonstrate a really neat property of vectors: if I subtract
\texttt{1} from the vector object \texttt{age}, R will kindly subtract
\texttt{1} from \emph{every value in the vector} at once:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age }\SpecialCharTok{{-}} \DecValTok{1}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 11 17 21 20 16
\end{verbatim}

Let's do something else neat. Let's create an entirely new vector
object, that I'm going to creatively call \texttt{age2}, which contains
the original \texttt{age} vector multiplied by 2.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age2 }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ age }\SpecialCharTok{*} \DecValTok{2}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If we want to look at what values \texttt{age2} contains, we can print
out its name and lo and behold, all of the values in \texttt{age2}
correspond to the original values in \texttt{age}, multiplied by 2:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age2}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 24 36 44 42 34
\end{verbatim}

The fact that mathematical operations applied to a vector are applied
separately to each individual value in the vector is called
\textbf{vectorization}.

While this might not seem \emph{that} cool to you. Trust me when I say
that this 100\% \emph{is} cool. Imagine how tired your fingers would get
if you had to subtract \texttt{1} from every individual value in a
vector containing 1000 values. With vectorization I just have to
subtract \texttt{1} from the vector object itself, and I'm done.

So now that we have two age vectors, \texttt{age} and \texttt{age2},
which are both printed below:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 12 18 22 21 17
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age2}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 24 36 44 42 34
\end{verbatim}

What do you think will happen if I try to add these two vectors
together?

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age2 }\SpecialCharTok{+}\NormalTok{ age}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 36 54 66 63 51
\end{verbatim}

Because vectors are \emph{vectorized}, the entries were added
\emph{element-wise}. This means that the first value in \texttt{age} was
added to the first value in \texttt{age2}, and similarly for the second
value, and so on and so forth.

Note that in the \texttt{age2\ +\ age} computation above, I printed out
the resulting vector, but I did not \emph{save} this vector as an
object. Having been computed, the \texttt{age2\ +\ age} vector has now
been lost to the ether. If I wanted to use this resulting vector for
something, I would need to \emph{save} it as a new variable (such as
\texttt{age3\ \textless{}-\ age2\ +\ age}).

Since we can add vectors together, it follows that we can probably also
subtract them from one another and multiply them by one another, and all
of these operations will happen \emph{element-wise}. For example, we can
divide \texttt{age2} by \texttt{age}, and we will get a vector
containing 5 \texttt{2}s, because each entry in \texttt{age2} is twice
the corresponding entry in \texttt{age}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age2 }\SpecialCharTok{/}\NormalTok{ age}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 2 2 2 2 2
\end{verbatim}

In this example, both \texttt{age} and \texttt{age2} have the same
\emph{length}. That is, they have the same number of entries.

What do you think will happen if we try to do a computation with vectors
of different lengths? Let's try to subtract a vector of length 2
(\texttt{c(1,\ 2)}) from \texttt{age}, which has length 5:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age }\SpecialCharTok{{-}} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Warning in age - c(1, 2): longer object length is not a multiple of shorter
object length
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 11 16 21 19 16
\end{verbatim}

Interestingly, it worked, but we got a warning message that says
``\emph{longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object
length}''. Take a look at the output of the code above. Can you figure
out what R did here?

R is being very presumptuous. Without even bothering to ask me, it went
ahead and repeated the values in the shorter vector, \texttt{c(1,\ 2)},
to match the length of the longer vector, \texttt{age}, i.e., until it
gets to 5 values in total, so it is essentially doing this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age }\SpecialCharTok{{-}} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 11 16 21 19 16
\end{verbatim}

Personally, I'd prefer if R gave me an error when I try to do
mathematical operations with vectors of different lengths. But
unfortunately for me, I didn't write the R programming language, I just
use it.

To be fair, R did provide a \emph{warning} that I was trying to do a
computation with vectors of different lengths. But it's really easy to
unintentionally ignore warnings.

If you ever see this warning, it probably means that you've made a
mistake somewhere. I can guarantee that you almost never actually want
to do mathematical operations with vectors of different lengths.

In summary, my advice is \emph{don't ignore} the warning message
``\emph{longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object
length}''. Check your lengths and check your code output!

Speaking of ``checking your lengths'', it might be helpful if I told you
how to do that! You can compute the length of a vector by applying the
\texttt{length()} function to it:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{length}\NormalTok{(age)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 5
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Vectorized logical
operations}\label{vectorized-logical-operations}

Do you remember when we asked questions about the values that we had
stored in our variables/objects, like \texttt{x\ ==\ 1}? Well it turns
out that we can ask the same questions of vectors! And, you guessed it,
those questions will be asked \emph{element-wise}.

Let's keep working with our \texttt{age} vector:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 12 18 22 21 17
\end{verbatim}

If we ask ``which \texttt{age} entries are greater or equal to 18''
using the code below:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age }\SpecialCharTok{\textgreater{}=} \DecValTok{18}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE
\end{verbatim}

This question gets asked separately for every entry in \texttt{age}. The
resulting logical vector above is \texttt{TRUE} for the \texttt{age}
entries that are 18 or above, and is \texttt{FALSE} for the \texttt{age}
entries that are less than 18.

Let's ask another question: ``which \texttt{age} entries are equal to
17''?

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age }\SpecialCharTok{==} \DecValTok{17}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE
\end{verbatim}

It looks like only the last one is.

What about ``which \texttt{age} entries are \emph{not} equal to 21''?

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age }\SpecialCharTok{!=} \DecValTok{21}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE
\end{verbatim}

What if we want to ask which \texttt{age} entries are equal to
\emph{either} 17 or 18? The natural thing to try is:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age }\SpecialCharTok{==} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{17}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{18}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Warning in age == c(17, 18): longer object length is not a multiple of shorter
object length
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE
\end{verbatim}

But notice our
\texttt{longer\ object\ length\ is\ not\ a\ multiple\ of\ shorter\ object\ length}
warning!

If we take a look at \texttt{age} again,

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 12 18 22 21 17
\end{verbatim}

It looks like \texttt{age\ ==\ c(17\ 18)} gave us the right answer (as
in, we got \texttt{TRUE} for the second and fifth entries), but I never
like to ignore a ``\emph{longer object length is not a multiple of
shorter object length}'' warning message.

Since the code \texttt{age\ ==\ c(17,\ 18)} worked, it should probably
also work if we switch the order of 18 and 17 in our question, right?

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age }\SpecialCharTok{==} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{18}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{17}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Warning in age == c(18, 17): longer object length is not a multiple of shorter
object length
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
\end{verbatim}

This time we still get some output, along with our ``longer object
length is not a multiple of shorter object length'' warning, but the
answer is \emph{wrong}. All of the entries in the output vector are
\texttt{FALSE}.

This is because R is doing that pesky recycling thing again. This
question is equivalent to:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age }\SpecialCharTok{==} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{18}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{17}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{18}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{17}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{18}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
\end{verbatim}

And the question is being asked element-wise (is the first entry equal
to \texttt{18}? Is the second entry equal to \texttt{17}? Is the third
entry equal to \texttt{18}?, etc). The only reason we got the correct
answer the first time is because we got lucky with our recycling.

The moral of the story: \emph{don't ignore} the warning message
``\emph{longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object
length}''. Check your lengths!

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{The \texttt{\%in\%}
operator}{The \%in\% operator}}\label{the-in-operator}

Okay, so if \texttt{age\ ==\ c(17,\ 18)} isn't how we ask the question
of which \texttt{age} entries are equal to \texttt{17} or \texttt{18},
how \emph{do} we ask that question?

We are going to use a new operator, \texttt{\%in\%}. To use
\texttt{\%in\%}, just replace \texttt{==} in the question above, with
\texttt{\%in\%}!

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# use \%in\% to ask which entries in age are equal to 17 or 18}
\NormalTok{age }\SpecialCharTok{\%in\%} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{17}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{18}\NormalTok{) }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE
\end{verbatim}

\emph{Et voila}! This time it tells us that the second and fifth entries
are equal to either 17 or 18, \emph{and} we didn't get any warnings!
Yay!

\section{Summary functions for
vectors}\label{summary-functions-for-vectors}

So I showed you earlier that you can use the \texttt{length()} function
to compute the number of values in a vector, but this is just one of
many function that you can use to summarize a vector.

For example, the \texttt{sum()} function can be used to add up all the
entries in a (numeric) vector:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{sum}\NormalTok{(age)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 90
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{mean()} function computes the mean/average:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{mean}\NormalTok{(age)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 18
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{median()} function computes the median:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{median}\NormalTok{(age)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 18
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{var()} function computes the variance:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{var}\NormalTok{(age)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 15.5
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{sd()} function computes the standard deviation:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{sd}\NormalTok{(age)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 3.937004
\end{verbatim}

The function \texttt{length()} tells you how many entries the vector
contains:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{length}\NormalTok{(age)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 5
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{min()} function tells you the smallest value:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{min}\NormalTok{(age)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 12
\end{verbatim}

And the \texttt{max} function tells you the biggest value:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{max}\NormalTok{(age)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 22
\end{verbatim}

And we can combine some of the super fun logical stuff from above with
\texttt{sum()} to compute even more interesting summaries.

First, note that when you apply \texttt{sum()} (or \texttt{mean()}) to a
vector of \emph{logical} values, it treats \texttt{FALSE} as \texttt{0}
and \texttt{TRUE} as \texttt{1}. So when you apply \texttt{sum()} to a
logical vector, it adds up the number of \texttt{TRUE} values:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# compute the number of TRUE values }
\FunctionTok{sum}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{, }\ConstantTok{FALSE}\NormalTok{, }\ConstantTok{FALSE}\NormalTok{, }\ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 2
\end{verbatim}

So we can use this to do things like add up the number of values in
\texttt{age} that are either 17 or 18:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{sum}\NormalTok{(age }\SpecialCharTok{\%in\%} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{17}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{18}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 2
\end{verbatim}

Or add the number of values in \texttt{age} that are strictly greater
than 15:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{sum}\NormalTok{(age }\SpecialCharTok{\textgreater{}} \DecValTok{15}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 4
\end{verbatim}

\section{Exercise}

Try to use the functions above to compute the \emph{proportion} of
people whose age is strictly greater than 15

\section{Hint}

Consider using the \texttt{sum()} function and the \texttt{length()}
function.

\section{Solution}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{sum}\NormalTok{(age }\SpecialCharTok{\textgreater{}} \DecValTok{15}\NormalTok{) }\SpecialCharTok{/} \FunctionTok{length}\NormalTok{(age)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 0.8
\end{verbatim}

\section{Extracting information from
vectors}\label{extracting-information-from-vectors}

We know how to put values into a vector (i.e., using \texttt{c()}), but
how do we get them out again?

To extract values from a vector, you can type the name of the vector
that you want to extract the values from, followed by some square
parentheses \texttt{{[}{]}}, inside which you place the numeric location
(index) of the value you want to extract.

Let's keep working with \texttt{age}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 12 18 22 21 17
\end{verbatim}

To extract the first entry from \texttt{age}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age[}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 12
\end{verbatim}

To extract the fourth entry from \texttt{age}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age[}\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 21
\end{verbatim}

If you want to extract the final entry in a vector and you don't
immediately know it's length, you can do something clever like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age[}\FunctionTok{length}\NormalTok{(age)]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 17
\end{verbatim}

Why does this work? Remember that \texttt{length(age)} tells you how
many values there are in \texttt{age} (i.e., 5), and so this is
equivalent to \texttt{age{[}5{]}}, which will extract the final value
from the \texttt{age} vector.

\subsection{Removing a value from a
vector}\label{removing-a-value-from-a-vector}

If I wanted to \emph{extract} the first entry from \texttt{age}, I would
write, \texttt{age{[}1{]}}. This is actually essentially creating a new
vector that just consists of the first value in \texttt{age} (although I
haven't saved this vector anywhere).

If I wanted to instead create a new vector that \emph{removed} this
first entry, I would write

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# remove the first entry from age}
\NormalTok{age[}\SpecialCharTok{{-}}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 18 22 21 17
\end{verbatim}

So \texttt{age{[}1{]}} \emph{extracts} the first entry from \texttt{age}
and \texttt{age{[}-1{]}} \emph{removes} the first entry from age.

Keep in mind, none of these operations so far have modified the original
\texttt{age} object:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 12 18 22 21 17
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{age{[}1{]}} prints the result of extracting the first entry from
\texttt{age}, but I am not saving this result, nor am I overwriting our
\texttt{age} vector with this value. Remember that the output of your
code is only saved when you assign the result of the computation to
something using \texttt{\textless{}-}!

\section{Exercise}

Remove the fourth entry from \texttt{age}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{12}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{18}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{22}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{21}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{17}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\section{Solution}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age[}\SpecialCharTok{{-}}\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 12 18 22 17
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Extracting/removing multiple entries from a
vector}\label{extractingremoving-multiple-entries-from-a-vector}

So far we have just extracted and removed a single entry from
\texttt{age} at a time. But often, we want to be able to extract or
remove multiple entries at once. That is, I want to provide multiple
values inside my square parentheses \texttt{{[}\ {]}}, but they only
accept one value!

Let's quickly remind ourselves of what \texttt{age} contains:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 12 18 22 21 17
\end{verbatim}

If I try to provide two values inside my \texttt{{[}\ {]}} parentheses,
I get an error. For example, below, I try to extract both the first and
third entries (\texttt{12} and \texttt{22}) from \texttt{age} at once by
just providing two numbers inside the square parentheses:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age[}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Error in age[1, 3]: incorrect number of dimensions
\end{verbatim}

But I got an error :(. The error\texttt{}``incorrect number of
dimensions''` is telling me that it only wants one object, not two
inside the square parentheses!

So I need to provide two position values (1 and 3), but I can only
provide one object inside. How could I create \emph{one} object that
contains \emph{two} values? One object\ldots{} two values\ldots{}
Hmmmmmmmm. Have you figured it out yet? Why don't you put the two values
inside a \emph{vector}! Wow! Neat idea!

Let's try and extract the first and third entries from \texttt{age} at
once, by providing a vector \texttt{c(1,\ 3)} inside the square
parentheses:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age[}\FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{)]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 12 22
\end{verbatim}

It worked!

Maybe we can also remove the first and third entries by providing the
negative of this vector:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age[}\SpecialCharTok{{-}}\FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{)]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 18 21 17
\end{verbatim}

That worked too! Vectors are great.

\section{Definining integer
sequences}\label{definining-integer-sequences}

What if you wanted to define a really long vector of sequential integers
like:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{my\_long\_vector }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{101}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{102}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{103}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{104}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{105}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{106}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{107}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{108}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{109}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{110}\NormalTok{, }
                    \DecValTok{111}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{112}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{113}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{114}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{115}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{116}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{117}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{118}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{119}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{120}\NormalTok{, }
                    \DecValTok{121}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{122}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{123}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{124}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{125}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{126}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{127}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{128}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{129}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{130}\NormalTok{, }
                    \DecValTok{131}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{132}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{133}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{134}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{135}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{136}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{137}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{138}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{139}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{140}\NormalTok{, }
                    \DecValTok{141}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{142}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{143}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{144}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{145}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{146}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{147}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{148}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{149}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{150}\NormalTok{, }
                    \DecValTok{151}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{152}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{153}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{154}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{155}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{156}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{157}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{158}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{159}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{160}\NormalTok{, }

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{my\_long\_vector}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
  [1] 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118

 [91] 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200
\end{verbatim}

Writing this out made my fingers really tired. And if you're learned
anything about me so far, you'll know how much I hate it when my fingers
get tired.

Fortunately, there's a better way. If I want to define a vector
containing a sequence of consecutive integers like in
\texttt{my\_long\_vector}, I can use the \texttt{:} syntax. For example,
to create the vector \texttt{c(1,\ 2,\ 3,\ 4)}, I could write:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DecValTok{1}\SpecialCharTok{:}\DecValTok{4}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 1 2 3 4
\end{verbatim}

Note that I haven't saved this vector (I just wrote the code to create
it and then the result was printed and subsequently lost to the ether),
but I could if I wanted to. Below, I save the above vector in an object
called \texttt{vector1to4}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{vector1to4 }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \DecValTok{1}\SpecialCharTok{:}\DecValTok{4}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

And then I can access this vector by writing its name:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{vector1to4}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 1 2 3 4
\end{verbatim}

The syntax to create a sequential vector of integers is
\texttt{start:stop}. So if \texttt{1:4} created the vector
\texttt{c(1,\ 2,\ 3,\ 4)}, how might you create the long vector that I
saved in \texttt{my\_long\_vector} above? Well the starting value is 101
and the last (stop) value is 200, so maybe we can try \texttt{101:200}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DecValTok{101}\SpecialCharTok{:}\DecValTok{200}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

Perfecto!

The cool thing about this is that we can use it to \emph{extract}
segments of a vector, for instance, to extract the first four entries of
\texttt{age}, we could write

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age[}\DecValTok{1}\SpecialCharTok{:}\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 12 18 22 21
\end{verbatim}

\section{Logical subsetting}\label{sec-logical-subsetting}

Sometimes you might want to extract all the entries from a vector that
satisfy a certain condition. To do that, you first need to understand
how you can use a logical vector to extract values.

If I provide a vector of \texttt{TRUE}s and \texttt{FALSE}s inside the
square parentheses, R will extract all of the values whose position in
the logical vector have a \texttt{TRUE}.

For example, the following code will extract the first, fourth, and
fifth entries:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age[}\FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{, }\ConstantTok{FALSE}\NormalTok{, }\ConstantTok{FALSE}\NormalTok{, }\ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{, }\ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{)]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 12 21 17
\end{verbatim}

OK. So I would never actually write out such a vector, because I have a
life, but remember earlier, when we asked logical questions of our
vectors, such as, which entries in \texttt{age} are greater than or
equal to 18:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age }\SpecialCharTok{\textgreater{}=} \DecValTok{18}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE
\end{verbatim}

This creates a logical vector for us \emph{and} the \texttt{TRUE} values
correspond to the values in the vector for which the condition is true.
Do you see where I'm going with this?

If you want to extract all of the values in a vector for which a logical
condition is true, you can provide the logical condition inside the
square parentheses of the vector!

The following code will extract the values in \texttt{age} that are all
greater or equal to 18:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age[age }\SpecialCharTok{\textgreater{}=} \DecValTok{18}\NormalTok{]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 18 22 21
\end{verbatim}

This is great for simple conditions, but what about more complex
conditions, such as ages that are at least 17 but less than 20.
Unfortunately, the R code that would correspond to the mathematical
syntax \(17 \leq x \leq 20\) doesn't work in R:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DecValTok{17} \SpecialCharTok{\textless{}=}\NormalTok{ age }\SpecialCharTok{\textless{}} \DecValTok{20}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Error: <text>:1:11: unexpected '<'
1: 17 <= age <
              ^
\end{verbatim}

Instead, we have to combine multiple conditions in R, using
\texttt{\textbar{}} if we want \emph{either} condition to be true (the
logical ``OR'') and \texttt{\&} for if we want \emph{both} conditions to
be true (the logical ``AND'').

The condition that the age is at least 17 but less than 20 is the
combination of the two conditions \texttt{age\ \textgreater{}=\ 17} and
\texttt{age\ \textless{}\ 20}, and we need both of these things to be
true, so we can write

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# age at least 17 and less than 20}
\NormalTok{(age }\SpecialCharTok{\textgreater{}=} \DecValTok{17}\NormalTok{) }\SpecialCharTok{\&}\NormalTok{ (age }\SpecialCharTok{\textless{}} \DecValTok{20}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE
\end{verbatim}

Combining conditions with an \texttt{\&} will only be \texttt{TRUE} if
both conditions are \texttt{TRUE}.

Let's use this ``AND'' condition to \emph{extract} all of the entries in
\texttt{age} that are both greater or equal to 17 \emph{and} less than
20.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age[(age }\SpecialCharTok{\textgreater{}=} \DecValTok{17}\NormalTok{) }\SpecialCharTok{\&}\NormalTok{ (age }\SpecialCharTok{\textless{}} \DecValTok{20}\NormalTok{)]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 18 17
\end{verbatim}

On the other hand, combining conditions with an \texttt{\textbar{}}
``OR'' operator will be \texttt{TRUE} if \emph{either} \texttt{TRUE}
(even if the other one is \texttt{FALSE}).

So for example, the ages that are \emph{either} less than 16 \emph{or}
greater than 20 are the first, third, and fourth entries

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{(age }\SpecialCharTok{\textless{}} \DecValTok{16}\NormalTok{) }\SpecialCharTok{|}\NormalTok{ (age }\SpecialCharTok{\textgreater{}} \DecValTok{20}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE
\end{verbatim}

And we can use this \texttt{\textbar{}} operator to \emph{extract} all
of the entries in \texttt{age} that are \emph{either} less than 16
\emph{or} greater than 20:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age[(age }\SpecialCharTok{\textless{}=} \DecValTok{16}\NormalTok{) }\SpecialCharTok{|}\NormalTok{ (age }\SpecialCharTok{\textgreater{}} \DecValTok{20}\NormalTok{)]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 12 22 21
\end{verbatim}

Sorry if your brain hurts.

Let's practice a little.

\section{Exercise}

Here is a new vector, \texttt{vec}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{vec }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{19}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{90}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{55}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{12}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Extract the entries that are less than 10

\section{Solution}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{vec[vec }\SpecialCharTok{\textless{}} \DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 4 2 2 3
\end{verbatim}

\section{Exercise}

Extract the entries of \texttt{vec} that are less than 25 but greater
than 10

\section{Solution}

Since I need both \texttt{vec\ \textless{}\ 25} and
\texttt{vec\ \textgreater{}\ 10} to be \texttt{TRUE}, this involves an
\texttt{\&} statement:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{vec[(vec }\SpecialCharTok{\textless{}} \DecValTok{25}\NormalTok{) }\SpecialCharTok{\&}\NormalTok{ (vec }\SpecialCharTok{\textgreater{}} \DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{)]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 19 12
\end{verbatim}

\section{Exercise}

Extract the entries of \texttt{vec} that are either less than 10 or
equal to 55

\section{Solution}

Since I only need either \texttt{vec\ \textless{}\ 10} and
\texttt{vec\ ==\ 55} to be \texttt{TRUE}, this involves an
\texttt{\textbar{}} statement:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{vec[(vec }\SpecialCharTok{\textless{}} \DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{) }\SpecialCharTok{|}\NormalTok{ (vec }\SpecialCharTok{==} \DecValTok{55}\NormalTok{)]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1]  4  2  2  3 55
\end{verbatim}

\section{Named vectors}\label{named-vectors}

If we wanted each entry in \texttt{age} to have it's own name, we could
use the \texttt{names()} function.

Note that \texttt{names(age)} extracts an attribute of \texttt{age} (its
names, which are currently nonexistent), and by assigning
\texttt{names(age)} to something, we can update the names.

Below, we update the names of the entries in \texttt{age} to be
``Dean'', ``Xiao'', ``Sara'', ``Ravi'', and ``Maya'', respectively.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{names}\NormalTok{(age) }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"Dean"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Xiao"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Sara"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Ravi"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Maya"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note that this \emph{does} modify the \texttt{age} object directly
(specifically, it modifies the \emph{names} of age through assignment
\texttt{\textless{}-}):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Dean Xiao Sara Ravi Maya 
  12   18   22   21   17 
\end{verbatim}

While you can define a vector and then update its names later, you can
alternatively create the names when you actually create the vector using
the syntax below.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"Dean"} \OtherTok{=} \DecValTok{12}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Xiao"} \OtherTok{=} \DecValTok{18}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Sara"} \OtherTok{=} \DecValTok{22}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Ravi"} \OtherTok{=} \DecValTok{21}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Maya"} \OtherTok{=} \DecValTok{17}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{age}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Dean Xiao Sara Ravi Maya 
  12   18   22   21   17 
\end{verbatim}

Take a look at the output of this ``named vector''. How does it look
different to the original unnamed \texttt{age} vector? The name for each
entry appears above the value, and the \texttt{{[}1{]}} at the beginning
of the vector that denotes the first entry is gone! I have no
explanation for why this second thing happens.

The cool thing about named vectors is that you can extract an entry from
a vector using its name. For example, if I just wanted Ravi's age, I
could write:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age[}\StringTok{"Ravi"}\NormalTok{]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Ravi 
  21 
\end{verbatim}

Note that the name of the entry must be a character string, i.e., I have
to have quotes around \texttt{"Ravi"}.

I can also extract several entries from the vector using a vector of the
names I want, just as I did with numbers representing the index
positions I wanted to extract:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{age[}\FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"Maya"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Ravi"}\NormalTok{)]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Maya Ravi 
  17   21 
\end{verbatim}

\section{Factors}\label{factors}

Before moving on to actually working with data (yay!), I want to talk
briefly about factors.

Factors are essentially vectors coupled with a set of allowed values.
For example, you will often find states (e.g., US states CA, OR, NY,
etc) stored as a factor, since there are a pre-defined set of states.

As an example, let's create a character vector of 10 Australian states
(where some states appear more than once--there are only 7 states
total):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{australia\_states }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"New South Wales"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"New South Wales"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Queensland"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Tasmania"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"ACT"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"South Australia"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Western Australia"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Northern Territory"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"New South Wales"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Queensland"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"ACT"}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{australia\_states}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
 [1] "New South Wales"    "New South Wales"    "Queensland"        
 [4] "Tasmania"           "ACT"                "South Australia"   
 [7] "Western Australia"  "Northern Territory" "New South Wales"   
[10] "Queensland"         "ACT"               
\end{verbatim}

and let's create a factor variable version of this vector using the
\texttt{factor()} function:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{australia\_states\_fct }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{factor}\NormalTok{(australia\_states)}
\NormalTok{australia\_states\_fct}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
 [1] New South Wales    New South Wales    Queensland         Tasmania          
 [5] ACT                South Australia    Western Australia  Northern Territory
 [9] New South Wales    Queensland         ACT               
7 Levels: ACT New South Wales Northern Territory ... Western Australia
\end{verbatim}

What are two differences between the output of the character vector,
\texttt{australia\_states} and the factor
\texttt{australia\_states\_fct}?

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The factor entries are not surrounded by quotes
\item
  Underneath the factor output there is some text that says
  \texttt{7\ Levels:\ ACT\ New\ South\ Wales\ ...\ Western\ Australia}
  -- these list the unique levels in the vector.
\end{enumerate}

Remember that we couldn't convert a character vector to a numeric
vector:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{as.numeric}\NormalTok{(australia\_states)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Warning: NAs introduced by coercion
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
 [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA
\end{verbatim}

It turns out that we can convert a factor to a numeric vector:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{as.numeric}\NormalTok{(australia\_states\_fct)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
 [1] 2 2 4 6 1 5 7 3 2 4 1
\end{verbatim}

But what is it doing? It is replacing all instances of the first level,
\texttt{ACT}, with \texttt{1}, all instances of the second level,
\texttt{New\ South\ Wales}, with \texttt{2}, etc. This can be very
handy, but also very dangerous.

To demonstrate why, let's create a factor containing numbers (factors
are not just reserved for text!)

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{fct }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{factor}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{))}
\NormalTok{fct}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 5 1 1 3 6 5 5 6 1
Levels: 1 3 5 6
\end{verbatim}

Notice that the factor \emph{levels} are unique (i.e,. \texttt{1} only
appears once in the levels, despite the fact that there are three
\texttt{1}s in the factor itself)

If I try to convert the factor to a numeric variable, the numbers got
all messed up:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{as.numeric}\NormalTok{(fct)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 3 1 1 2 4 3 3 4 1
\end{verbatim}

What R is doing here is replacing the first level entry, \texttt{1},
with \texttt{1} (so the \texttt{1}s remain untouched), it is replacing
the second level entry, \texttt{3}, with \texttt{2}, and replacing the
third level entry, \texttt{5}, with \texttt{3}, and so on.

It's hard to give concrete advice about factors at this stage, because
they only really become relevant when you start doing fancy statistical
modelling or creating sophisticated graphics using categorical data. For
the most part, unless you are using a model that requires factor
variables, your life will be ever so slightly easier if you store your
categorical/text information as character vectors and your numeric
information as numeric vectors rather than factors. Once you get to the
modeling stage, you'll see that 80\% of the functions that require your
categorical data to be a factor will automatically convert them to a
factor for you anyway.

\chapter{Data Frames}\label{data-frames}

Let's imagine that you have an actual dataset, which contains a
collection of columns (``variables'' in data terminology) and rows
(``observations'' in data terminology). For example, maybe your dataset
is:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule\noalign{}
Name & Age & Favorite Color \\
\midrule\noalign{}
\endhead
\bottomrule\noalign{}
\endlastfoot
Dean & 12 & Blue \\
Xiao & 18 & Green \\
Sara & 22 & Red \\
Ravi & 21 & Purple \\
Maya & 17 & Blue \\
\end{longtable}

In this case, your dataset has three \emph{``variables''} (name, age,
and favorite color), and five \emph{``observations''} (corresponding to
5 unique people). You might even recognize this data from the previous
chapter: the values in the ``Age'' column are the values from our
\texttt{age} vector from the previous chapter, and the names correspond
to the names that we gave our age vector!

While we could define a separate vector variable in R for each column in
our data, such as

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# three vectors containing info on each person\textquotesingle{}s name, age, and favorite color}
\NormalTok{name\_vec }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"Dean"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Xiao"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Sara"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Ravi"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Maya"}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{age\_vec }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{12}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{18}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{22}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{21}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{17}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{color\_vec }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"blue"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}green\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}red\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}purple\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}blue\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Once we started analyzing this data, it would quickly become hard to
keep track of which age corresponded to which name, and what their
corresponding favorite color is since the variables are each stored in
three separate objects. If I look at the \texttt{color\_vec} vector by
typing its name:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{color\_vec}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "blue"   "green"  "red"    "purple" "blue"  
\end{verbatim}

There is no way for me to tell who's color preference is who's.

It would be much nicer if we could create a \emph{single} object
containing each of these variables such that the corresponding values
are ``aligned''. Ideally, it will be very clear that the person with
name ``Ravi'' has age 21 and favorite color ``purple''.

Fortunately, the creators of R share our desires, and so they let us
store each of our vectors in a kind of object called a ``\textbf{data
frame}''.

If I already have the columns of my data stored as separate vectors, I
can create a data frame using the \texttt{data.frame()} function as
follows:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{my\_data }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{data.frame}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{name =}\NormalTok{ name\_vec,}
                      \AttributeTok{age =}\NormalTok{ age\_vec, }
                      \AttributeTok{color =}\NormalTok{ color\_vec)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

And since \texttt{my\_data} is an object in R, I can view it by typing
its name:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{my\_data}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
  name age  color
1 Dean  12   blue
2 Xiao  18  green
3 Sara  22    red
4 Ravi  21 purple
5 Maya  17   blue
\end{verbatim}

Now our data is now neatly arranged in rows and columns, where there is
one row for each person and one column for each different variable
\emph{and} it is all stored in a single variable/object called
\texttt{my\_data}. Thanks R!

The integer numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 shown along the left-hand side of
the rows are not actually a part of the data object itself (notice that
there is no ``column name'' printed above these integers). These numbers
are just visual aids provided by the R console when you print a data
frame object to make it a little bit easier to count the rows in the
data.

If I ask R what kind of object \texttt{my\_data} is, it tells me it's a
``data.frame''.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{class}\NormalTok{(my\_data)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "data.frame"
\end{verbatim}

And I can get a quick summary of what my data frame contains using the
\texttt{str} function:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{str}\NormalTok{(my\_data)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
'data.frame':   5 obs. of  3 variables:
 $ name : chr  "Dean" "Xiao" "Sara" "Ravi" ...
 $ age  : num  12 18 22 21 17
 $ color: chr  "blue" "green" "red" "purple" ...
\end{verbatim}

In particular, the things that I find helpful in this summary are the
number of ``obs.'' (5) and ``variables'' (3), and the type/class of each
variable printed after its name--it tells me that the \texttt{name} and
\texttt{color} columns have a ``chr'' (character) type, and the
\texttt{age} variable has a ``num'' (numeric) type.

This means that each column in a data frame can have a different type,
but \textbf{each entry within a single column must be the same type}
(and that's because each column corresponds to a vector).

I can even extract the individual vectors back from my dataframe using
similar syntax to our vectors (and named vectors) from the previous
chapter. For example, if I wanted to extract the age vector from the
\texttt{my\_data} data frame, I can write

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{my\_data}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{age}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 12 18 22 21 17
\end{verbatim}

or

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{my\_data[}\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}age\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
  age
1  12
2  18
3  22
4  21
5  17
\end{verbatim}

But notice how the output of these two column extraction tecnhiques look
a little different? Can you figure out why? Hint: What type/class do you
think each output object has? Look at its formatting. Learning to
recognize what type of object you are looking at by the way it looks is
a good skill to start developing.

The output of \texttt{my\_data\$age} \emph{looks} like an ordinary
vector, right? The values are arranged horizontally, and we can see the
\texttt{{[}1{]}} at the beginning of the output. But this isn't the case
for the output of
\texttt{my\_data{[}\textquotesingle{}age\textquotesingle{}{]}}. The
output here looks more like our data frame output! Except that there is
only one column\ldots{}

Indeed, if I ask R to tell me the class of each of these two objects
that I have extracted, I learn that the \texttt{my\_data\$age} object
has a ``numeric'' type (but remember that a vector containing numeric
values will have a ``numeric'' type!)

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{class}\NormalTok{(my\_data}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{age)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "numeric"
\end{verbatim}

and I learn that the
\texttt{my\_data{[}\textquotesingle{}age\textquotesingle{}{]}} object
has a ``data.frame'' type:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{class}\NormalTok{(my\_data[}\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}age\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{])}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "data.frame"
\end{verbatim}

Since data frames and vectors have different behaviors, I might prefer
one over the other. But just to confuse you a little bit more, I can use
the \texttt{df{[}{]}} syntax to extract a vector object, but I just need
to provide two square parentheses in my extraction:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{my\_data[[}\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}age\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{]]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 12 18 22 21 17
\end{verbatim}

Now this looks more like a vector!

While I will occasionally want to extract columns from my data as a
vector using one of these techniques, I actually typically conduct my
data analyses and modifications using the data frame object itself.
You'll see a range of techniques for working with data in a data frame
in the next chapter.

But first, I want to show you how to load a dataset that you have saved
on your computer into R!

\section{Loading in data from external
files}\label{loading-in-data-from-external-files}

To create our \texttt{my\_data} data frame objet above, we first created
the individual vectors and we used them to define the individual columns
of our data frame within the \texttt{data.frame()} function.

Imagine if your data had hundreds of observations/values for each of
hundreds of variables. You probably don't want to sit there manually
typing your dataset's values into R.

If the data you want to analyze lives in a .csv file or an Excel
spreadsheet on our computer, then there exist functions that you can use
to load your data into a data frame!

\subsection{Loading data from .csv data
files}\label{loading-data-from-.csv-data-files}

CSV files are one of the \emph{simplest} data formats. CSV stands for
``comma separated value''. In a CSV file:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Every entry in a row is separated by a comma
\item
  New rows are created by starting a new line
\end{itemize}

the CSV version of our dataframe above looks like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{name, age, color}
\NormalTok{Dean, 12, blue}
\NormalTok{Xiao, 18, green}
\NormalTok{Sara,  22, red}
\NormalTok{Ravi, 21, purple}
\NormalTok{Maya, 17, blue}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

To load in a dataset (as a data frame) from a csv file, we can use the
\texttt{read.csv()} function. However, in order for R to be able to find
your file you need to provide a ``filepath'' (as a character/text value)
to your csv file, which corresponds to where your file lives on your
computer relative to where the current R file you are working in is
saved. Ideally, you are working in a quarto document. If so, identify
where on your computer you have saved your quarto document. If your csv
data file lives in the same folder as your quarto document, then you
will write

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{data }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{read.csv}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"filename.csv"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

where you replace \texttt{"filename.csv"} which the actual file name of
your csv file.

If your csv data file lives in a \texttt{data/} subfolder of the folder
that contains your quarto document, then you will write

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{data }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{read.csv}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"data/filename.csv"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This will save the data contained in your \texttt{"filename.csv"} file
(which in this example lives in a \texttt{data/} subfolder) as an object
in R called \texttt{data}.

\section{Working Directories}\label{working-directories}

Your \textbf{working directory} corresponds to the folder location on
your computer that your console in running. Filepaths in the console are
relative to your current working directory, regardless of where your
quarto document or R script that you have open is saved.

If you opened RStudio or positron or whichever IDE you are working on by
opening a quarto document or R script directly, your working directory
will probably be automatically set to the folder containing your file.
However, if you opened your IDE without opening a file, your working
directory may be your computer's home folder.

This means that it is possible that your console's working directory may
not match the location in which you saved your quarto document or R
script. In this case, if R will not be able to find your files if you
write your filepaths relative to the location of your saved document
(which is recommended).

Fortunately, you can update your console's working directory to be the
location of your current quarto document or R script in RStudio by
choosing ``Session \textgreater{} Set Working Directory \textgreater{}
To Source File Location''.

Let's load a csv file. If you are working in a quarto document or an R
script on your computer, take note of where you saved it. Create a new
folder called ``data'' in the same location as your current document.
Then download the gapminder dataset and move it to your new ``data''
folder.

Then, assuming that your console's working directory matches the
location where your quarto document or R script has been saved, you
should be able to run this code below to load in the gapminder csv data
file and save it as an object called \texttt{gapminder} using the
\texttt{read.csv()} function.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{read.csv}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{file =} \StringTok{"data/gapminder.csv"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If you get an error that says
\texttt{"Warning\ message:\ In\ file(file,\ "rt")\ :\ cannot\ open\ file\ \textquotesingle{}data/gapminder.csv\textquotesingle{}:\ No\ such\ file\ or\ directory"},
this means that either you did not set up your file in the right place,
or your console's working directory is incorrect!

Hopefully you figured out how to tell R to find and load your dataset!
If your code above worked, you should then be able to take a look at the
gapminder object by typing its name:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

But this clearly prints out A LOT of data!

In general, you will want to try to avoid printing your entire dataset
in your R console or quarto output. Try printing just the first few (6,
to be exact) rows using the \texttt{head()} function:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{(gapminder)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
      country continent year lifeExp      pop gdpPercap
1 Afghanistan      Asia 1952  28.801  8425333  779.4453
2 Afghanistan      Asia 1957  30.332  9240934  820.8530
3 Afghanistan      Asia 1962  31.997 10267083  853.1007
4 Afghanistan      Asia 1967  34.020 11537966  836.1971
5 Afghanistan      Asia 1972  36.088 13079460  739.9811
6 Afghanistan      Asia 1977  38.438 14880372  786.1134
\end{verbatim}

So what is this ``gapminder'' data? The gapminder dataset contains
information on life expectancy, population, and GDP per capita for 142
countries over the years 1952 to 2007. If you want to learn more about
it for some reason, head on over to the
\href{https://www.gapminder.org/}{gapminder website}.

\subsection{Describing attributes of a
dataframe}\label{describing-attributes-of-a-dataframe}

Now that we have a dataframe containing our data, we can print out just
the column names using the \texttt{colnames()} function:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{colnames}\NormalTok{(gapminder)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "country"   "continent" "year"      "lifeExp"   "pop"       "gdpPercap"
\end{verbatim}

This is particularly useful for dataframes with a lot of columns.

We can also ask things like how many rows and columns our data frame
has:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# compute the number of rows (nrow)}
\FunctionTok{nrow}\NormalTok{(gapminder)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 1704
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# compute the number of columns (ncol)}
\FunctionTok{ncol}\NormalTok{(gapminder)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 6
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# do both at the same time (dim)}
\FunctionTok{dim}\NormalTok{(gapminder)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 1704    6
\end{verbatim}

We can use our trusty \texttt{str()} function from earlier to take a
sneak peak at the ``structure'' of our data:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{str}\NormalTok{(gapminder)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
'data.frame':   1704 obs. of  6 variables:
 $ country  : chr  "Afghanistan" "Afghanistan" "Afghanistan" "Afghanistan" ...
 $ continent: chr  "Asia" "Asia" "Asia" "Asia" ...
 $ year     : int  1952 1957 1962 1967 1972 1977 1982 1987 1992 1997 ...
 $ lifeExp  : num  28.8 30.3 32 34 36.1 ...
 $ pop      : int  8425333 9240934 10267083 11537966 13079460 14880372 12881816 13867957 16317921 22227415 ...
 $ gdpPercap: num  779 821 853 836 740 ...
\end{verbatim}

And we can use the \texttt{summary()} function to get some statistical
summaries (like the minimum, median, mean, maximum and the quartiles) of
each of the numeric columns in our dataframe (this summary is fairly
useless for character columns though):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# use summary() to look at a summary of gapminder}
\FunctionTok{summary}\NormalTok{(gapminder)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

Your turn: load the world happiness dataset from the
\texttt{whr\_2023.csv} file. Save it as a variable called
\texttt{world\_happiness}. Then print out the first 10 rows, the column
names, create a summary of the data, report its dimension.

\section{Installing and loading R packages}\label{sec-readxl}

If you are unfortunate enough to receive your data in the format of an
Excel file, you can still load it into R! However, to load excel files,
you will need to \textbf{install the ``readxl'' R package}.

R packages are collections of ``add-on'' R functions that you can
``load'' into your R session to provide you with additional
functionality. For example, the ``readxl'' package provides functions
that allow you to read in data from Excel files.

To use functions from a package, you need to do two things:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Install the package onto your computer. You only need to do this once.
\item
  Load your package into your current R session. You need to do this
  every time you start a new R session (i.e., every time you open up
  RStudio).
\end{enumerate}

To install the ``readxl'' package, you can write the following code
\emph{directly into your console}. I \emph{don't} recommend saving this
code in a quarto document or R script, because you only need to install
a package once.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# run in the console: }
\FunctionTok{install.packages}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"readxl"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

But every time you want to \emph{use} an installed R package in a new R
session, you need to \emph{``load''} it using the library() function (we
R folk use the words ``library'' and ``package'' interchangeably).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(readxl)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Since you need to run this every time you open RStudio, you should
include this code at the top of your quarto document or R script.

You will often see a lot of message ``output'' when you load libraries.
This is \emph{completely normal}. Don't freak out. Unless you see the
word ``Error'' in the message. Then it's not a message at all, it's an
error, and you should probably freak out. Or just check that you've
installed the package. Either works, but I imagine that one is more
productive than the other.

If you are loading a library in a quarto document and you want to hide
the message output in the resulting rendered document, you can use the
chunk option \texttt{\#\textbar{}\ message:\ false}, such as:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\InformationTok{\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}\{r\}}
\InformationTok{\#| message: false}
\InformationTok{library(readxl)}
\InformationTok{\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\section{Loading data from Excel
files}\label{loading-data-from-excel-files}

Ok, so now that we've loaded our ``readxl'' library, we should be able
to use the \texttt{read\_excel()} function! As you may have surmised,
the \texttt{read\_excel()} function will load in a dataset from an Excel
file.

Just for fun, I have also created an excel version of the gapminder
data, \texttt{gapminder.xls}. Let's load that in using the
\texttt{read\_excel()} function from the ``readxl'' library. This code
will only work if you have first installed the ``readxl'' package at
some time in the past, and in this session you have run the
\texttt{library("readxl")} code to ``load'' the library into your R
session.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder\_excel }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{read\_excel}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"data/gapminder.xls"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If you have an excel file with lots of sheets, be aware that this
function will only load the \emph{first} sheet. However, you can use the
\texttt{sheet} argument to load other sheets.

In the \texttt{gapminder.xls} file, you will see that there is in fact a
second sheet, containing the rows for Australia only. To load in this
second sheet, we use our \texttt{read\_excel()} function with the
\texttt{sheet\ =\ 2} argument:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# use the "sheet" argument to load in just the second sheet containing Australia\textquotesingle{}s data}
\NormalTok{gapminder\_excel\_australia }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{read\_excel}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"data/gapminder.xls"}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{sheet =} \DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\section{Loading data from SPSS, Stata and SAS files using the haven
package}\label{loading-data-from-spss-stata-and-sas-files-using-the-haven-package}

I'm not going to go into details here, but if you happen to have data in
SPSS, Stata, or SAS file formats, the ``haven'' package has functions
that you can use to load in these files.

Once you've installed (\texttt{install.packages("haven")}) and loaded
(\texttt{library(haven)}) the ``haven'' package, you should have access
to the following functions:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{SAS}: \texttt{read\_sas()} reads .sas7bdat and .sas7bcat files
  and \texttt{read\_xpt()} reads SAS transport files (versions 5 and 8).
\item
  \textbf{SPSS}: \texttt{read\_sav()} reads .sav files and
  \texttt{read\_por()} reads the older .por files.
\item
  \textbf{Stata}: \texttt{read\_dta()} reads .dta files (up to version
  15).
\end{itemize}

\section{Data Frames}\label{data-frames-1}

Let me preface the rest of this chapter by saying that I don't actually
want you to read it, because there is a better way to do literally
everything that is shown from this point in this chapter. Like way
better. And that'll be the topic of the next chapter.

So why did I even write the following content? I wrote it because I want
to show you the misery of working with dataframes without the tidyverse.
Without this content, you won't be able to fully appreciate the beauty
of the tidyverse that will be introduced in the next chapter. If your
only exposure to working with data in R is through the tidyverse, you'll
take it for granted. Don't take the tidyverse for granted. It's special,
Ok? Besides, if you haven't already, at some point in your R journeys
you're going to encounter code written by other people that uses a lot
of the syntax from this chapter, and I want to make sure that you
understand it.

The rest of this chapter is all about working with data using ``base
R''. When I say ``base R'' here, I mean R functions and syntax that are
available to you without requiring that you install and load any
additional packages. That is, they are part of the ``base'' R language
itself. Since this chapter corresponds to a new quarto document, I'm
going to go ahead and load our trust gapminder dataframe using the
\texttt{read.csv()} function (which is itself a base R function!!).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{read.csv}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"data/gapminder.csv"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

And let's take a look at the first few rows:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{(gapminder)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\section{\texorpdfstring{Extracting columns from a dataframe using the
\texttt{\$}
operator}{Extracting columns from a dataframe using the \$ operator}}\label{extracting-columns-from-a-dataframe-using-the-operator}

If you only take away one thing from this chapter, let it be that you
can extract a column from a dataframe using a dollar sign: \texttt{\$}.
Despite the fact that this is technically a ``base R'' technique for
working with data frames, I do actually use it all the time.

For example, if I want to extract the \texttt{country} column from
\texttt{gapminder} as a \emph{vector}, I can write:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{country}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

What kind of object is this? It's a (very long) vector! You can use the
\texttt{head()} function on vectors too to just look at the first 6
values:

\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{(gapminder}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{country)}

\begin{verbatim}

\section{Extracting individual entries from a data
frame}\label{extracting-individual-entries-from-a-data-frame}

For the rest of this chapter, I'm going to show you several base R
techniques of extracting subsets of rows and columns from your
dataframe. I give you permission to skim.

To extract individual entries from a data frame using base R, you can
write the name of the data frame object (such as \texttt{gapminder})
immediately followed by some \emph{square} parentheses with two values
separated by a comma. The first value will correspond to the row-number
of the value you want to extract, and the second value will correspond
to the column position of the value, which can either be the numeric
index position (e.g., \texttt{2} for the second column) or the name of
the column as a character value, such as \texttt{"country"}.

For example, to extract the entry in the 3rd row and 4th column of
\texttt{gapminder}, you can write:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder[}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 31.997
\end{verbatim}

Or you can use the column name in the second (column) position of the
square parentheses:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder[}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"lifeExp"}\NormalTok{]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 31.997
\end{verbatim}

If you want to extract multiple values, you can use the \texttt{c()}
function to create a vector of row or column indices. For example, to
extract the entries in the 3rd and 4th rows and 4th column, you can
write:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder[}\FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{), }\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 31.997 34.020
\end{verbatim}

and if you want to extract the entries in the 3rd and 4th rows and the
4th and 5th columns, you can write:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder[}\FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{), }\FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{)]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
  lifeExp      pop
3  31.997 10267083
4  34.020 11537966
\end{verbatim}

Or you can use the column names:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder[}\FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{), }\FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"lifeExp"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"pop"}\NormalTok{)]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
  lifeExp      pop
3  31.997 10267083
4  34.020 11537966
\end{verbatim}

\section{Exercise}

What type of object do each of these extraction techniques output?
Before using the \texttt{class()} function to check, try and just look
at the output and visually identify what type of object (vector, data
frame, numeric value, etc) each output is.

\section{Solution}

Any output object that contains an individual value is just a standalone
value. Any output object that contains a single column is a vector. Any
output object that contains multiple columns are a data frame.

\subsection{Extracting entire columns from a data
frame}\label{extracting-entire-columns-from-a-data-frame}

There are many ways to extract a single \emph{column} from a data frame
using base R syntax. You've already seen one:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{(gapminder}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{lifeExp)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 28.801 30.332 31.997 34.020 36.088 38.438
\end{verbatim}

But you can also use the square parenthesis syntax to extract an entire
column by leaving the first row index position in the square parentheses
blank. For example, the following code will extract the entire fourth
column (and just print out the head):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{(gapminder[, }\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{])}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 28.801 30.332 31.997 34.020 36.088 38.438
\end{verbatim}

And the following code will do the same thing using the name of the
fourth column instead of its index position:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{(gapminder[, }\StringTok{"lifeExp"}\NormalTok{])}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 28.801 30.332 31.997 34.020 36.088 38.438
\end{verbatim}

Here's a fun question for you (and don't try to tell me I don't know
what ``fun'' means!)\ldots{} What do you think the output of the
following code will be:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{(gapminder[}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{])}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

And what about:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{(gapminder[}\StringTok{"year"}\NormalTok{])}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

How is this code different from what we were just doing above?

Above whenever we were using the square parenthesis syntax, we provided
two values: the row position and the column position. If we wanted all
of the rows, we left the row position blank, but we still had the comma,
for example \texttt{gapminder{[},3{]}}. But in the code above, we only
provided one value, and no commas inside the square parentheses!

If you tried it out yourself, you will have seen that the output of
these two pieces of code above where we just provide a number of a
column name inside the square parentheses without any commas is the
relevant column, but what type of object is it? Is
\texttt{gapminder{[}"year"{]}} different from
\texttt{gapminder{[},\ "year"{]}}? Take a look at the two outputs:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{(gapminder[, }\StringTok{"year"}\NormalTok{])}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 1952 1957 1962 1967 1972 1977
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{(gapminder[}\StringTok{"year"}\NormalTok{])}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
  year
1 1952
2 1957
3 1962
4 1967
5 1972
6 1977
\end{verbatim}

What type of objects are they? The first one is a vector, and the second
one is a single-column data frame!

And just to confuse you even further, there is yet another way to
extract a column: you can use double square parentheses
\texttt{{[}{[}{]}{]}}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{(gapminder[[}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{]])}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 1952 1957 1962 1967 1972 1977
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{(gapminder[[}\StringTok{"year"}\NormalTok{]])}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 1952 1957 1962 1967 1972 1977
\end{verbatim}

If you want the technical explanation of why this works, a data frame
can be thought of as a ``list'' of vectors, and the way that you extract
entries from a list is using double square parentheses, so
\texttt{df{[}{[}3{]}{]}} will extract the third vector of the list,
which is the same as the third column of the data frame. If you've never
seen a list before, don't worry for now. We will talk about lists later
in this book, but I'll introduce them properly when that time comes. We
don't really need to know about lists to work with data frames.

\section{Using logical indexing to extract subsets of data
frames}\label{using-logical-indexing-to-extract-subsets-of-data-frames}

While being able to extract subsets of your data frame using row and
column position, you probably don't want to have to figure out the row
and column positions of every value that you want to extract.
Fortunately, you don't have to! You can use that logical subsetting
stuff that I went on and on about way back in
Section~\ref{sec-logical-subsetting}.

Let's use logical subsetting to create a logical vector, called
\texttt{is\_aus} that is \texttt{TRUE} when the corresponding row's
country value is ``Australia'' and \texttt{FALSE} otherwise.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{is\_aus }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ gapminder}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{country }\SpecialCharTok{==} \StringTok{"Australia"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Remember that \texttt{vec\ ==\ "value"} will ask whether every value in
the vector \texttt{vec} (in our example, this is the country column of
gapminder \texttt{gapminder\$country}) is equal to \texttt{"Australia"},
and will return \texttt{TRUE} if it is and \texttt{FALSE} if it is not.
So the \texttt{is\_aus} variable will contain a vector of \texttt{TRUE}
and \texttt{FALSE} values. Since this vector is going to be long (its
length equals the number of rows in \texttt{gapminder}), let's just look
at the first 100 entries using \texttt{head()} (we can specify how many
rows we want to look at by providing a second argument to head, in this
case, \texttt{100}):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{(is\_aus, }\DecValTok{100}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
  [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
 [13] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
 [25] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
 [37] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
 [49] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
 [61]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
 [73] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
 [85] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
 [97] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
\end{verbatim}

One trick to ask how many \texttt{TRUE} values there are in a logical
vector is to use the \texttt{sum()} function. This is because
\texttt{TRUE} is treated as \texttt{1} and \texttt{FALSE} is treated as
\texttt{0}, so the sum of a logical vector will be the number of
\texttt{TRUE} values in the vector.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{sum}\NormalTok{(is\_aus)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 12
\end{verbatim}

So why do we want to create this logical vector? It turns out that we
can use it to filter to just the rows for Australia by providing it in
the row indexing position of our square parentheses like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder[is\_aus, ]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
     country continent year lifeExp      pop gdpPercap
61 Australia   Oceania 1952  69.120  8691212  10039.60
62 Australia   Oceania 1957  70.330  9712569  10949.65
63 Australia   Oceania 1962  70.930 10794968  12217.23
64 Australia   Oceania 1967  71.100 11872264  14526.12
65 Australia   Oceania 1972  71.930 13177000  16788.63
66 Australia   Oceania 1977  73.490 14074100  18334.20
67 Australia   Oceania 1982  74.740 15184200  19477.01
68 Australia   Oceania 1987  76.320 16257249  21888.89
69 Australia   Oceania 1992  77.560 17481977  23424.77
70 Australia   Oceania 1997  78.830 18565243  26997.94
71 Australia   Oceania 2002  80.370 19546792  30687.75
72 Australia   Oceania 2007  81.235 20434176  34435.37
\end{verbatim}

Since I didn't provide anything in the second position
\texttt{{[}is\_aus,\ {]}}, this returned all of the columns.

This is pretty helpful, but it can get kind of messy, especially if we
want to avoid defining intermediate objects (which I generally do). The
way I wrote the code above involved defining an ``intermediate object''
corresponding to the \texttt{is\_aus} logical vector:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{is\_aus }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ gapminder}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{country }\SpecialCharTok{==} \StringTok{"Australia"}
\NormalTok{gapminder[is\_aus, ]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
     country continent year lifeExp      pop gdpPercap
61 Australia   Oceania 1952  69.120  8691212  10039.60
62 Australia   Oceania 1957  70.330  9712569  10949.65
63 Australia   Oceania 1962  70.930 10794968  12217.23
64 Australia   Oceania 1967  71.100 11872264  14526.12
65 Australia   Oceania 1972  71.930 13177000  16788.63
66 Australia   Oceania 1977  73.490 14074100  18334.20
67 Australia   Oceania 1982  74.740 15184200  19477.01
68 Australia   Oceania 1987  76.320 16257249  21888.89
69 Australia   Oceania 1992  77.560 17481977  23424.77
70 Australia   Oceania 1997  78.830 18565243  26997.94
71 Australia   Oceania 2002  80.370 19546792  30687.75
72 Australia   Oceania 2007  81.235 20434176  34435.37
\end{verbatim}

But I could have done this all in one row by writing:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder[gapminder}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{country }\SpecialCharTok{==} \StringTok{"Australia"}\NormalTok{, ]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
     country continent year lifeExp      pop gdpPercap
61 Australia   Oceania 1952  69.120  8691212  10039.60
62 Australia   Oceania 1957  70.330  9712569  10949.65
63 Australia   Oceania 1962  70.930 10794968  12217.23
64 Australia   Oceania 1967  71.100 11872264  14526.12
65 Australia   Oceania 1972  71.930 13177000  16788.63
66 Australia   Oceania 1977  73.490 14074100  18334.20

72 Australia   Oceania 2007  81.235 20434176  34435.37
\end{verbatim}

You will often see this kind of code. For now, it's still fairly
readable, but if I want to proide multiple conditions for my filtering,
for example I just want to subset to the rows corresponding to
\texttt{country\ ==\ "Australia"} and
\texttt{year\ \textgreater{}\ 1990}, I can do this by using the
\texttt{\&} operator to combine the two logical vectors:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder[(gapminder}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{country }\SpecialCharTok{==} \StringTok{"Australia"}\NormalTok{) }\SpecialCharTok{\&}\NormalTok{ (gapminder}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{year }\SpecialCharTok{\textgreater{}} \DecValTok{1990}\NormalTok{), ]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
     country continent year lifeExp      pop gdpPercap
69 Australia   Oceania 1992  77.560 17481977  23424.77
70 Australia   Oceania 1997  78.830 18565243  26997.94
71 Australia   Oceania 2002  80.370 19546792  30687.75
72 Australia   Oceania 2007  81.235 20434176  34435.37
\end{verbatim}

This gets messy fairly quickly, and I personally find it kind of hard to
read. But don't worry, in the next chapter, I will show you a much nicer
way to do this!

\section{Removing columns using negative
indexing}\label{removing-columns-using-negative-indexing}

Remember how you could remove a value from a vector by providing a
negative value inside the indexing parentheses, such as
\texttt{vec{[}-2{]}} for removing the second entry of the vector.

You can use negative indexing to remove columns of a data frame too! The
following code will remove the third column (\texttt{year}) from
gapminder, and show just the first 6 rows:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{(gapminder[}\SpecialCharTok{{-}}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{])}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
      country continent lifeExp      pop gdpPercap
1 Afghanistan      Asia  28.801  8425333  779.4453
2 Afghanistan      Asia  30.332  9240934  820.8530
3 Afghanistan      Asia  31.997 10267083  853.1007
4 Afghanistan      Asia  34.020 11537966  836.1971
5 Afghanistan      Asia  36.088 13079460  739.9811
6 Afghanistan      Asia  38.438 14880372  786.1134
\end{verbatim}

Note that this doesn't modify the original \texttt{gapminder} object,
because I have not reassigned \texttt{gapminder} (which would involve
writing \texttt{gapminder\ \textless{}-\ gapminder{[}-3{]}}). This code
above just shows you what \texttt{gapminder} would look like if you
removed the third column (And then looked at its head).

\section{Adding columns}\label{adding-columns}

Just as you can remove columns from a data frame using the square
parenthesis index syntax, you can also \emph{add} new columns to a data
frame. However, since adding a column involve \emph{assigning} the new
column to somthing, this \emph{will} modify the gapminder object. To
avoid modifying our original \texttt{gapminder} object, let's create a
new version of it called \texttt{gapminder\_tmp} (for ``gapminder
temporary''). I can do that by assigning \texttt{gapminder\_tmp} to
\texttt{gapminder}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder\_tmp }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ gapminder}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If I wanted to add a new column to \texttt{gapminder\_tmp}, I can use
the \texttt{\$} syntax to define \texttt{gapminder\_tmp\$gdp} (the
column I want to create that does not yet exist) by assigning it to the
vector of values that I want it to contain.

The \texttt{gdp} column that I want to create will correspond to the
product of the \texttt{gdpPercap} column and the \texttt{pop} column
(note that \texttt{gapminder\_tmp\$gdpPercap} and
\texttt{gapminder\_tmp\$pop} are both vectors and their product is also
a vector):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder\_tmp}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{gdp }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ gapminder\_tmp}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{gdpPercap }\SpecialCharTok{*}\NormalTok{ gapminder\_tmp}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{pop}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Let's take a look at our modified \texttt{gapminder\_tmp} data frame:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{(gapminder\_tmp)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
      country continent year lifeExp      pop gdpPercap         gdp
1 Afghanistan      Asia 1952  28.801  8425333  779.4453  6567086330
2 Afghanistan      Asia 1957  30.332  9240934  820.8530  7585448670
3 Afghanistan      Asia 1962  31.997 10267083  853.1007  8758855797
4 Afghanistan      Asia 1967  34.020 11537966  836.1971  9648014150
5 Afghanistan      Asia 1972  36.088 13079460  739.9811  9678553274
6 Afghanistan      Asia 1977  38.438 14880372  786.1134 11697659231
\end{verbatim}

Notice that there is a new \texttt{gdp} column at the end!

Note that we could alternatively do this using the square parenthesis
syntax:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder\_tmp[, }\StringTok{"gdp"}\NormalTok{] }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ gapminder\_tmp[, }\StringTok{"gdpPercap"}\NormalTok{] }\SpecialCharTok{*}\NormalTok{ gapminder\_tmp[, }\StringTok{"pop"}\NormalTok{]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

As well as the using version of indexing that doesn't involve a row
index position (i.e., \texttt{df{[}"col"{]}} instead of
\texttt{df{[},\ "col"{]}}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder\_tmp[}\StringTok{"gdp"}\NormalTok{] }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ gapminder\_tmp[}\StringTok{"gdpPercap"}\NormalTok{] }\SpecialCharTok{*}\NormalTok{ gapminder\_tmp[}\StringTok{"pop"}\NormalTok{]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

These all do the same thing!

\section{Exercise}

Modify the \texttt{lifeExp} column of \texttt{gapminder\_tmp} so that it
is rounded to the nearest integer (use \texttt{round()}).

\emph{Hint:} you can undo your changes to \texttt{gapminder\_tmp} by
reassigning it to the original \texttt{gapminder} object
(\texttt{gapminder\_tmp\ \textless{}-\ gapminder})

\section{Solution}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# for all rows:}
\NormalTok{gapminder\_tmp}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{lifeExp }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{round}\NormalTok{(gapminder\_tmp}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{lifeExp)}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

In the next chapter I'm going to show you better ways of doing literally
everything that I just showed you. So feel free to forget everything you
just read. Get ready to enter into the tidyverse!

\part{The Tidyverse}

\chapter{Data frames with dplyr}\label{data-frames-with-dplyr}

In this chapter, I'm finally going to introduce the tidyverse! Are you
excited? I know I am!

I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that I genuinely don't think
the R programming language would be nearly as widespread and useful as
it is today if it were not for the tidyverse and the human who first
created it, Hadley Wickham. Since R is an open source language, anyone
can be an R developer, which means that you can take the R programming
language and create your own functions that enhance it. And one of the
most successful R developers is Hadley Wickham, who created the ggplot2
R package (which you'll meet in the next chapter) as a part of his PhD,
and later a range of other packages, including dplyr (which is the topic
if this chapter). These packages, along with several others, form what
is now called the ``tidyverse'' (because they serve to help you create
``tidy'' data), to which hundreds of brilliant people have contributed.

The tidyverse ecosystem and its impacts are a true testament to the
power of the open source community.

To get started with dplyr, ggplot2, and the other tidyverse packages,
you need to \emph{install} them. To make our lives a little bit too
easy, you can now simultaneously install all of the tidyverse packages
(ggplot2, dplyr, reshape, purrr, readr, and many others) by just
installing a single ``tidyverse'' library.

\section{Installing and Loading R
packages}\label{installing-and-loading-r-packages}

In case you didn't read Section~\ref{sec-readxl}, where we introduced
packages, I'm going to repeat what I wrote here.

R packages are collections of ``add-on'' R functions that you can
``load'' into your R session to provide you with additional
functionality. For example, the ``dplyr'' package provides functions
that allow you to work with data frames.

To use functions from a package, you need to do two things:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Install the package onto your computer. \emph{You only need to do this
  once.}
\item
  Load your package into your current R session. \emph{You need to do
  this every time you start a new R session (i.e., every time you open
  up RStudio).}
\end{enumerate}

To install the ``dplyr'' package, you can write the following code
\emph{directly into your console}. I \emph{don't} recommend saving this
code in a quarto document or R script, because you only need to install
a package once.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# run in the console: }
\FunctionTok{install.packages}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"dplyr"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

But every time you want to \emph{use} an installed R package in a new R
session, you need to \emph{``load''} it using the library() function (we
R folk use the words ``library'' and ``package'' interchangeably).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(dplyr)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

Attaching package: 'dplyr'
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':

    filter, lag
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
The following objects are masked from 'package:base':

    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
\end{verbatim}

Since you need to run this every time you open RStudio, you should
include this code at the top of your quarto document or R script.

You will often see a lot of message ``output'' when you load libraries.
This is \emph{completely normal}. Don't freak out. Unless you see the
word ``Error'' in the message. Then it's not a message at all, it's an
error, and you should probably freak out. Or just check that you've
installed the package. Either works, but I imagine that one is more
productive than the other.

If you are loading a library in a quarto document and you want to hide
the message output in the resulting rendered document, you can use the
chunk option \texttt{\#\textbar{}\ message:\ false}, such as:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\InformationTok{\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}\{r\}}
\InformationTok{\#| message: false}
\InformationTok{library(dplyr)}
\InformationTok{\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\section{The tidyverse library}\label{the-tidyverse-library}

Throughout the next few chapters, we are going to be working with the
tidyverse library. The tidyverse library is a little bit special. While
it is an R package (like the ``readxl'' R package from
Section~\ref{sec-readxl} and ``dplyr'', above), the tidyverse is
actually a package that contains a bunch of different packages, one of
which is the ``dplyr'' package that we just installed and loaded above!

The tidyverse also includes the ``ggplot2'' library that we will be
working with in a few chapters, and most of the other libraries that we
will be using throughout this book. While you can install and load these
libraries separately, it is actually more common to just load the
``tidyverse'', which will load all of the included libraries at once.

As an exercise, go ahead and install the tidyverse library (write
\texttt{install.packages("tidyverse")} directly in the console) and then
load it into your R session (\texttt{library(tidyverse)}). Remember that
you don't want to include the \texttt{install.packages("tidyverse")}
code in your quarto document or R script, because you only need to
install a package once, but you will want to include the
\texttt{library(tidyverse)} code at the top of your document, because
you will need to run this every time you start a new R session. Note
that you need quotes for ``tidyverse'' in the
\texttt{install.packages()} function, but not in the \texttt{library()}
function.

As an analogy, think of installing an R package
(\texttt{install.packages("tidyverse")}) as downloading and installing
an application from the internet onto your computer. Then think of
loading an R package (\texttt{library(tidyverse)}) as opening that
application on your computer. You only need to download and install an
application once, but you need to open (load) it every time you want to
use it.

Therefore, the first code chunk in most of my quarto documents is just:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\InformationTok{\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}\{r\}}
\InformationTok{\#| message: false}
\InformationTok{library(tidyverse)}
\InformationTok{\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\section{\texorpdfstring{Tibbles and the \texttt{read\_csv()}
function}{Tibbles and the read\_csv() function}}\label{tibbles-and-the-read_csv-function}

Up until now, we have been using a base R function (\texttt{read.csv()})
to load our gapminder dataset. While it's perfectly fine to continue to
use this function, it is recommended that you switch to a slightly
different function that has an underscore instead of a period in its
name: \texttt{read\_csv()}. This function is part of the tidyverse and
is a little bit more efficient and user-friendly than
\texttt{read.csv()}.

Let's use \texttt{read\_csv()} (the tidyverse version of
\texttt{read.csv()}) to load the gapminder dataset:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{read\_csv}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"data/gapminder.csv"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Rows: 1704 Columns: 6
-- Column specification --------------------------------------------------------
Delimiter: ","
chr (2): country, continent
dbl (4): year, lifeExp, pop, gdpPercap

i Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
i Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.
\end{verbatim}

If you ran this in your own console and you got an error saying
``\emph{Error in read\_csv(''data/gapminder.csv'') : could not find
function ''read\_csv''}'', make sure you have installed the tidyverse
and have run the code \texttt{library(tidyverse)} in your console! R can
only find the \texttt{read\_csv()} function if you have loaded the
tidyverse!

Now let's take a look at gapminder (\emph{without using
\texttt{head()}})

\begin{Shaded}

\end{verbatim}

Here are the main differences:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The version loaded using the base R \texttt{read.csv()} function
  prints out the first 1000 rows (though I've put them all in a cute a
  scrolly box for you), whereas the version loaded using the tidyverse
  \texttt{read\_csv()} function only prints out the first 10 rows (and
  10 columns).
\item
  The version loaded using the tidyverse \texttt{read\_csv()} function
  will also show you what \emph{type}/\emph{class} each columns has.
  Look underneath the column names of the tidyverse \texttt{read\_csv()}
  version of \texttt{gapminder} above. See the
  \texttt{\textless{}chr\textgreater{}} and
  \texttt{\textless{}dbl\textgreater{}} symbols? These mean
  ``character'' and ``double'' (``double'' means ``numeric with
  decimals''), respectively.
\item
  The tidyverse \texttt{read\_csv()} version prints out some information
  at the top that says \texttt{\#\ A\ tibble:\ 1,704\ ×\ 6}, which tells
  us that our data frame has 1,704 rows and 6 columns. But what's the
  ``tibble'' part? It turns out that \texttt{read\_csv()} doesn't
  actually load your data in as a data frame. It loads your data in as a
  \emph{``tibble''}.
\end{enumerate}

A tibble is just a fancy data frame. In fact, for our purposes, a tibble
\emph{is} just a data frame. The only difference is that when it is
printed to the console or as output in your quarto document, the tibble
will only print the first 10 rows and the first 10 columns, as well as
the extra pieces of information listed above. Overall, tibbles are just
a bit more user friendly than the classic data frame, but it really
doesn't matter whether you load in your data as a tibble using
\texttt{read\_csv()} or as a data frame using \texttt{read.csv()}.
Especially because many of the functions that are going to be introduced
in this chapter will output a tibble regardless of whether their input
is a tibble or a data frame.

From here on, I will use the term data frame and tibble interchangeably
to mean the same thing (I will usually use the term ``data frame'' even
if the object is a tibble). If you don't understand the difference.
Don't worry. Whenever you see ``tibble'', just replace it with ``data
frame'' in your head, and you're good to go.

\section{The dplyr library}\label{the-dplyr-library}

Probably the most important library in the tidyverse is the ``dplyr''
library. The ``dplyr'' library contains a bunch of functions that allow
you to do things (like select columns, modify columns, filter based on
conditions, etc) with data frames really easily.

Like all ``tidyverse'' packages, to access the functions from the
``dplyr'' package, you just need to load the tidyverse library using
\texttt{library(tidyverse)}.

The main dplyr functions you need to master are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{select()}: extract columns from your data frame
\item
  \texttt{filter()}: filter to rows of your data frame based on a
  condition
\item
  \texttt{mutate()}: add columns or modify columns in your data frame
\item
  \texttt{summarize()}: aggregate information in your columns
\item
  \texttt{group\_by()}: perform an operation separately for each entry
  in a categorical column
\end{itemize}

Once you feel comfortable with these five functions, you're officially a
competent tidyverse R user. We're going to introduce all of them in this
chapter, one by one. Then we're going to do fancy things like
\emph{combining} them together with something called the ``\emph{pipe}''
(which looks like this: \texttt{\textbar{}\textgreater{}} or like this
\texttt{\%\textgreater{}\%} if you've been around the R scene for a
while)

Ready? Let's go!

\section{Select() for extacting
columns}\label{select-for-extacting-columns}

We can use the \texttt{select()} function to extract specific named
columns from our data frame.

The \emph{first argument} of \texttt{select()} is always the data frame
on which you are operating, and all of the \emph{remaining arguments}
are the names of the columns that you want to keep. Note that the column
names do \emph{not} have quotes around them. This is something that
makes dplyr (and tidyverse) functions special (and involves something
called ``tidy evaluation'' that we won't talk about any time soon).

So if we want to extract just the country, year, and life expectancy
columns from our gapminder data frame, we can write:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{select}\NormalTok{(gapminder, country, year, lifeExp)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 1,704 x 3
   country      year lifeExp
   <chr>       <dbl>   <dbl>
 1 Afghanistan  1952    28.8
 2 Afghanistan  1957    30.3
 3 Afghanistan  1962    32.0
 4 Afghanistan  1967    34.0
 5 Afghanistan  1972    36.1
 6 Afghanistan  1977    38.4
 7 Afghanistan  1982    39.9
 8 Afghanistan  1987    40.8
 9 Afghanistan  1992    41.7
10 Afghanistan  1997    41.8
# i 1,694 more rows
\end{verbatim}

We can also remove columns by using a minus sign in front of the column
name. For example, the following code will return the gapminder data
frame \emph{without} the continent, year, and pop columns:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{select}\NormalTok{(gapminder, }\SpecialCharTok{{-}}\NormalTok{continent, }\SpecialCharTok{{-}}\NormalTok{year, }\SpecialCharTok{{-}}\NormalTok{pop)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 1,704 x 3
   country     lifeExp gdpPercap
   <chr>         <dbl>     <dbl>
 1 Afghanistan    28.8      779.
 2 Afghanistan    30.3      821.
 3 Afghanistan    32.0      853.
 4 Afghanistan    34.0      836.
 5 Afghanistan    36.1      740.
 6 Afghanistan    38.4      786.
 7 Afghanistan    39.9      978.
 8 Afghanistan    40.8      852.
 9 Afghanistan    41.7      649.
10 Afghanistan    41.8      635.
# i 1,694 more rows
\end{verbatim}

Select can also help you rename columns. If you just provide the column
name as an argument, the column name will remain unchanged. However, if
you provide the column name as \texttt{new\_name\ =\ old\_name}, the
column will be renamed to whatever you provide as \texttt{new\_name}.
For example, the following code will return the gapminder data frame
with the country, year, lifeExp, and gdpPercap columns, except the
lifeExp column will be renamed to life\_exp and the gdpPercap column
renamed to gdp\_per\_cap:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{select}\NormalTok{(gapminder, country, year, }\AttributeTok{life\_exp =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp, }\AttributeTok{gdp\_per\_cap =}\NormalTok{ gdpPercap)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 1,704 x 4
   country      year life_exp gdp_per_cap
   <chr>       <dbl>    <dbl>       <dbl>
 1 Afghanistan  1952     28.8        779.
 2 Afghanistan  1957     30.3        821.
 3 Afghanistan  1962     32.0        853.
 4 Afghanistan  1967     34.0        836.
 5 Afghanistan  1972     36.1        740.
 6 Afghanistan  1977     38.4        786.
 7 Afghanistan  1982     39.9        978.
 8 Afghanistan  1987     40.8        852.
 9 Afghanistan  1992     41.7        649.
10 Afghanistan  1997     41.8        635.
# i 1,694 more rows
\end{verbatim}

However, since select will only return the columns that are included in
its arguments, if you want to rename a column without removing any
columns, you might want to use the \texttt{rename()} function instead.

For example, the following code will return \emph{all columns} in the
gapminder data frame, with the lifeExp column renamed to life\_exp and
the gdpPercap column renamed to gdp\_per\_cap:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{rename}\NormalTok{(gapminder, }\AttributeTok{life\_exp =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp, }\AttributeTok{gdp\_per\_cap =}\NormalTok{ gdpPercap)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 1,704 x 6
   country     continent  year life_exp      pop gdp_per_cap

\section{\texorpdfstring{The pipe \texttt{\textbar{}\textgreater{}}
(formerly
\texttt{\%\textgreater{}\%})}{The pipe \textbar\textgreater{} (formerly \%\textgreater\%)}}\label{the-pipe-formerly}

Remember how I was being all gushy about the tidyverse? Honestly, the
main reason for that is the \textbf{pipe}. The pipe makes is so we can
read our code as if it is a sentence. For example, if I wanted to turn
the following sentence ``\emph{I take my backpack and then I put books
in it and then put it on my back}'' using the pipe, I would write
\texttt{backpack\ \textbar{}\textgreater{}\ put\_books\_in()\ \textbar{}\textgreater{}\ put\_on\_back()}.
I always think of the pipe operator \texttt{\textbar{}\textgreater{}} as
the word ``and then'' in a sentence.

So for the following code, I can read it as ``\emph{take the gapminder
data frame and then select the country, year, and lifeExp columns}'':

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}} \FunctionTok{select}\NormalTok{(country, year, lifeExp)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 1,704 x 3
   country      year lifeExp
   <chr>       <dbl>   <dbl>
 1 Afghanistan  1952    28.8
 2 Afghanistan  1957    30.3
 3 Afghanistan  1962    32.0
 4 Afghanistan  1967    34.0
 5 Afghanistan  1972    36.1
 6 Afghanistan  1977    38.4
 7 Afghanistan  1982    39.9
 8 Afghanistan  1987    40.8
 9 Afghanistan  1992    41.7
10 Afghanistan  1997    41.8
# i 1,694 more rows
\end{verbatim}

The pipe syntax is:
\texttt{object\ \textbar{}\textgreater{}\ function()}. The way it works
is that the object to the left of the pipe
(\texttt{\textbar{}\textgreater{}}) is placed into the \emph{first
argument} of the function to the right of the pipe
(\texttt{\textbar{}\textgreater{}}).

This means that the following two pieces of code are equivalent:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# apply head() to gapminder directly}
\FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{(gapminder)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 6 x 6

  <chr>       <chr>     <dbl>   <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>
1 Afghanistan Asia       1952    28.8  8425333      779.
2 Afghanistan Asia       1957    30.3  9240934      821.

4 Afghanistan Asia       1967    34.0 11537966      836.
5 Afghanistan Asia       1972    36.1 13079460      740.
6 Afghanistan Asia       1977    38.4 14880372      786.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# apply head() to gapminder using the pipe}
\NormalTok{gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}} \FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 6 x 6

  <chr>       <chr>     <dbl>   <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>
1 Afghanistan Asia       1952    28.8  8425333      779.
2 Afghanistan Asia       1957    30.3  9240934      821.
3 Afghanistan Asia       1962    32.0 10267083      853.

6 Afghanistan Asia       1977    38.4 14880372      786.
\end{verbatim}

The second version with the pipe takes the \texttt{gapminder} data frame
(which is to the left of the pipe) and places it into the (first)
argument of the \texttt{head()} function on the right of the pipe. The
pipe always has an object (like a data frame) on its left and a function
on its right.

Here is another example of two pieces of equivalent code, first one with
the pipe:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# apply select to gapminder, year, and pop without the pipe}
\FunctionTok{select}\NormalTok{(gapminder, year, pop)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 1,704 x 2
    year      pop
   <dbl>    <dbl>
 1  1952  8425333
 2  1957  9240934
 3  1962 10267083
 4  1967 11537966
 5  1972 13079460
 6  1977 14880372
 7  1982 12881816
 8  1987 13867957
 9  1992 16317921
10  1997 22227415
# i 1,694 more rows
\end{verbatim}

And the version with the pipe:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# apply select to gapminder, year, and pop with the pipe}
\NormalTok{gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}} \FunctionTok{select}\NormalTok{(year, pop)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 1,704 x 2
    year      pop
   <dbl>    <dbl>
 1  1952  8425333
 2  1957  9240934
 3  1962 10267083
 4  1967 11537966
 5  1972 13079460
 6  1977 14880372
 7  1982 12881816
 8  1987 13867957
 9  1992 16317921
10  1997 22227415
# i 1,694 more rows
\end{verbatim}

Remember that the pipe places the object on the left of the pipe into
the first argument of the function on the right of the pipe. So if the
function takes more than one argument (as \texttt{select()} does), then
you place the remaining arguments inside the parentheses of the function
on the right of the pipe.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, rightrule=.15mm, toptitle=1mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-tip-color}{\faLightbulb}\hspace{0.5em}{The ``new'' pipe \texttt{\textbar{}\textgreater{}} versus the ``old''
pipe \texttt{\%\textgreater{}\%}}, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, coltitle=black, titlerule=0mm, opacityback=0, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, arc=.35mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, breakable, toprule=.15mm, colback=white]

The pipe \texttt{\textbar{}\textgreater{}} is now a part of the R
programming language. Previously, you needed to load the magrittr,
dplyr, or tidyverse libraries to access the pipe and it had a different
symbol: \texttt{\%\textgreater{}\%} (there are very minor differences in
functionality). This still works, but it is now recommended that you use
the newer ``native'' pipe syntax: \texttt{\textbar{}\textgreater{}}.

\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Filtering rows using
filter()}\label{filtering-rows-using-filter}

The filter function lets you filter to specific rows based on a
condition.

Imagine that we just want to look at the rows in the data corresponding
to Australia. Recall that you can apply \emph{logical operations} to a
vector (in this case the ``country'' column of \texttt{gapminder}) as
follows:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{country }\SpecialCharTok{==} \StringTok{"Australia"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If we just take the part of this statement that follows the \texttt{\$}

argument of the \texttt{filter()} function, we can filter to just the
rows in the data frame where the country is Australia (Note: no
\texttt{\$} extraction required!):

Just like \texttt{select()}, the first argument of \texttt{filter()} is
always the data frame on which you are operating. The second argument of
\texttt{filter()} is the condition that you want to use filter. Only the
rows for which the condition is \texttt{TRUE} will be returned. However,
you can refer to the column names without quotes inside dplyr functions,
even though there is no \texttt{country} variable in our environment.

\subsection{Multiple filtering
conditions}\label{multiple-filtering-conditions}

You can provide multiple conditions using a comma, i.e., by providing
multiple conditions as arguments to \texttt{filter()}. For example, the
following code will filter the \texttt{gapminder} data frame to just the
rows where both \texttt{country\ ==\ "Australia"} AND
\texttt{year\ \textgreater{}\ 1990} are \texttt{TRUE}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{filter}\NormalTok{(gapminder, country }\SpecialCharTok{==} \StringTok{"Australia"}\NormalTok{, year }\SpecialCharTok{\textgreater{}} \DecValTok{1990}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 4 x 6

4 Australia Oceania    2007    81.2 20434176    34435.
\end{verbatim}

And now that we have met our trusty pipe, we can rewrite this code as:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}} \FunctionTok{filter}\NormalTok{(country }\SpecialCharTok{==} \StringTok{"Australia"}\NormalTok{, year }\SpecialCharTok{\textgreater{}} \DecValTok{1990}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 4 x 6

  <chr>     <chr>     <dbl>   <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>
1 Australia Oceania    1992    77.6 17481977    23425.
2 Australia Oceania    1997    78.8 18565243    26998.
3 Australia Oceania    2002    80.4 19546792    30688.
4 Australia Oceania    2007    81.2 20434176    34435.
\end{verbatim}

Remember that you can read this as ``take the gapminder data frame
\emph{and then} filter to the rows where the country is Australia and
the year is greater than 1970''.

While the pipe might not seem to be bringing much to the party just yet,
rest assured the pipe is a game changer. To start to get a sense of why,
let's use it to combine some sequential \texttt{filter()} and
\texttt{select()} operations.

First: filter to the continent of Africa, where the year is equal to
1992

Then: return just the country and lifeExp columns (rename lifeExp to be
life\_exp)

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}} 
  \FunctionTok{filter}\NormalTok{(continent }\SpecialCharTok{==} \StringTok{"Africa"}\NormalTok{, year }\SpecialCharTok{==} \DecValTok{1992}\NormalTok{) }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}} 
  \FunctionTok{select}\NormalTok{(country, }\AttributeTok{life\_exp =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 52 x 2

   <chr>                       <dbl>
 1 Algeria                      67.7
 2 Angola                       40.6
 3 Benin                        53.9
 4 Botswana                     62.7
 5 Burkina Faso                 50.3
 6 Burundi                      44.7
 7 Cameroon                     54.3
 8 Central African Republic     49.4
 9 Chad                         51.7
10 Comoros                      57.9
# i 42 more rows
\end{verbatim}

Note that I like to start a new line \emph{after} each pipe
\texttt{\textbar{}\textgreater{}} to make the code more readable.

How would you read this code as a sentence? I would read it as ``take
the gapminder dataset \emph{and then} filter to just the rows where the
continent column is equal to''Africa'' and the year is equal to 1992
\emph{and then} select just the country and life expectancy columns,
renaming life expectancy to be life\_exp''.

If I wanted to try to write this code without the pipe, I would have to
do it in a few steps like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder\_africa\_1992 }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{filter}\NormalTok{(gapminder, continent }\SpecialCharTok{==} \StringTok{"Africa"}\NormalTok{, year }\SpecialCharTok{==} \DecValTok{1992}\NormalTok{)}
\FunctionTok{select}\NormalTok{(gapminder\_africa\_1992, country, }\AttributeTok{life\_exp =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 52 x 2
   country                  life_exp
   <chr>                       <dbl>
 1 Algeria                      67.7
 2 Angola                       40.6
 3 Benin                        53.9
 4 Botswana                     62.7
 5 Burkina Faso                 50.3
 6 Burundi                      44.7
 7 Cameroon                     54.3
 8 Central African Republic     49.4
 9 Chad                         51.7
10 Comoros                      57.9
# i 42 more rows
\end{verbatim}

Without the pipe, I am forced to define an intermediate object,
\texttt{gapminder\_africa\_1992} (or do some kind of disgusting nested
function stuff), which feels inefficient now that we have the pipe. The
pipe allows me to do everything in a single more readable and efficient
operation.

\subsection{The order of operations}\label{the-order-of-operations}

It turns out that the order of operations can be fairly important.

For example, if I swap the order of the \texttt{select()} operation and
the \texttt{filter()} operation in the code above, I will get an error:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# swap the filter and select steps above}
\NormalTok{gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}} 
  \FunctionTok{select}\NormalTok{(country, }\AttributeTok{life\_exp =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp) }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}}
  \FunctionTok{filter}\NormalTok{(continent }\SpecialCharTok{==} \StringTok{"Africa"}\NormalTok{, year }\SpecialCharTok{==} \DecValTok{1992}\NormalTok{) }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Error in `filter()`:
i In argument: `continent == "Africa"`.
Caused by error:
! object 'continent' not found
\end{verbatim}

Why do you think this happens? Take a look at the error message for a
hint. The issue is not that the \texttt{gapminder} object itself doesn't
contain a ``continent'' column\ldots{} what data frame is being piped
into the \texttt{filter()} function? You can run just the first two
lines of code to see:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}} 
  \FunctionTok{select}\NormalTok{(country, }\AttributeTok{life\_exp =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp) }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 1,704 x 2
   country     life_exp
   <chr>          <dbl>
 1 Afghanistan     28.8
 2 Afghanistan     30.3
 3 Afghanistan     32.0
 4 Afghanistan     34.0
 5 Afghanistan     36.1
 6 Afghanistan     38.4
 7 Afghanistan     39.9
 8 Afghanistan     40.8
 9 Afghanistan     41.7
10 Afghanistan     41.8
# i 1,694 more rows
\end{verbatim}

This is the data frame that is being piped into \texttt{filter()}. Does
it contain a ``continent'' column? No it does not! So the
\texttt{filter()} function is trying to filter to rows for which the
``continent'' column is equal to ``Africa'' in a data frame that doesn't
contain a ``continent'' column. The following two pieces of code are
therefore \emph{not} equivalent:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}} 
  \FunctionTok{filter}\NormalTok{(continent }\SpecialCharTok{==} \StringTok{"Africa"}\NormalTok{, year }\SpecialCharTok{==} \DecValTok{1992}\NormalTok{) }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}}
  \FunctionTok{select}\NormalTok{(country, }\AttributeTok{life\_exp =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp) }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}} 
  \FunctionTok{select}\NormalTok{(country, }\AttributeTok{life\_exp =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp) }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}}
  \FunctionTok{filter}\NormalTok{(continent }\SpecialCharTok{==} \StringTok{"Africa"}\NormalTok{, year }\SpecialCharTok{==} \DecValTok{1992}\NormalTok{) }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\subsection{Filtering using ``OR''
conditions}\label{filtering-using-or-conditions}

How would you go about filtering to the rows where country corresponds
to Australia and Italy. You might imagine that you can just provide
these two conditions separated by a comma, as in:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}} \FunctionTok{filter}\NormalTok{(country }\SpecialCharTok{==} \StringTok{"Australia"}\NormalTok{, country }\SpecialCharTok{==} \StringTok{"Italy"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 0 x 6
# i 6 variables: country <chr>, continent <chr>, year <dbl>, lifeExp <dbl>,
#   pop <dbl>, gdpPercap <dbl>
\end{verbatim}

However, this has returned an \emph{empty} data frame with 0 rows. Why
has this happened?

Remember that whenever you provide two conditions to \texttt{filter()}
with a comma, R filters to the rows where \emph{both} conditions are
true. That is, a comma corresponds to an ``AND'' condition:
\texttt{filter(country\ ==\ "Australia",\ country\ ==\ "Italy")} means
``filter to the rows where \texttt{country\ ==\ "Australia"} AND
\texttt{country\ ==\ "Italy"} are both true. However, there are no rows
where \texttt{country} is simultaneously equal to''Australia'' and
``Italy''. It is only ever equal to one or the other.

Although I phrased my desire as ``filter to the rows where country
country corresponds to Australia \textbf{and} Italy'', I really meant,
``filter to the rows country corresponds to Australia \textbf{or}
Italy''.

Can you remember how to ask an ``OR'' question? You use the vertical bar
\texttt{\textbar{}}. So to ask this question, I could provide two
conditions separated by a vertical bar
\texttt{(condition\ 1)\ \textbar{}\ (condition\ 2)}, which will return
all rows where \emph{either} condition 1 \emph{or} condition 2 are
satisfied.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}} \FunctionTok{filter}\NormalTok{((country }\SpecialCharTok{==} \StringTok{"Australia"}\NormalTok{) }\SpecialCharTok{|}\NormalTok{ (country }\SpecialCharTok{==} \StringTok{"Italy"}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 24 x 6

   <chr>     <chr>     <dbl>   <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>

\end{verbatim}

Or if both conditions involve the same variable (in this case,
\texttt{country}), you can use the \texttt{\%in\%} operator! Remember
that you can ask which values in a vector are also in some other vector,
such as asking which values in the vector
\texttt{c(1,\ 5,\ 2,\ 2,\ 1,\ 6)} are equal to \texttt{1} or \texttt{2}
(i.e., are in the vector \texttt{c(1,\ 2)}) by writing:

We can use this same \texttt{\%in\%}operator to ask which entries of
\texttt{country} column are equal to \texttt{"Australia"} or

\section{Exercise}

Filter gapminder to all countries on the Oceania continent for just the
years 1987 and 1992 and select just the country, year, and gdpPercap
columns (where you have renamed \texttt{gdpPercap} to be
\texttt{gdp\_per\_cap}).

Save the output in an object called gapminder\_oceania, and print
\texttt{gapminder\_oceania} to the console.

\section{Adding and modifying columns using

Let's move from filtering our rows using \texttt{filter()} onto adding
and modifying our columns using \texttt{mutate()}!

If I wanted to add a new column to my data, called \texttt{gdp}, which
is the product of the \texttt{pop} and \texttt{gdpPercap} columns, I can
do that using \texttt{mutate()}.

Remember that the code above hasn't actually modified gapminder. To
modify gapminder I would need to \emph{reassign} gapminder to the
mutated dataframe:
\texttt{gaminder\ \textless{}-\ gapminder\ \textbar{}\textgreater{}\ mutate(gdp\ =\ pop\ *\ gdpPercap)}.

What this code has done is it has created a brand new column,
\texttt{gdp}, and plopped it at the end of my data frame (and it's
printed out the resulting data frame without saving it as a new
variable). In this case, each value in the \texttt{gdp} column contains
product of the corresponding values in the \texttt{pop} and
\texttt{gdpPercap} columns.

The general syntax for mutate is
\texttt{df\ \textbar{}\textgreater{}\ mutate(new\ column\ name\ =\ some\ operation\ involving\ existing\ columns)},
and because \texttt{mutate()} is a tidyverse function, we can refer to
the columns of our data frame without needing quotes.

As another example, if we wanted to create a new column that contained
the population in millions, i.e., divided by 1 million, we could do that
using

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

Note that \texttt{1e6} is scientific notation for \texttt{1000000}
(i.e., \texttt{1} followed by 6 \texttt{0}s).

While \texttt{mutate()} is often used to create \emph{new} columns, it
can also be used to \emph{modify existing} columns. For example, the
code below will modify the existing \texttt{lifeExp} column by rounding
it to the nearest integer.

Note that no new columns have been added to the end of our
\texttt{gapminder} output. The data frame contains the exact same
columns as the original \texttt{gapminder} object, except the
\texttt{lifeExp} column is now an integer!

Modify \texttt{gapminder\_tmp} using mutate() so that it contains a
log(pop) column (in addition to the original \texttt{pop} column), and
round the gdpPercap column to the nearest integer. The first 6 rows of
your output should look like this:

\section{Summarizing data frames using
summarize()}\label{summarizing-data-frames-using-summarize}

The functions that we have discussed do far in this chapter
(\texttt{select()}, \texttt{filter()} and \texttt{mutate()}) are all
functions that can be used to create a \emph{modified} version of your
data frame.

In this section, we will introduce \texttt{summarize()}, which can be
used to--you guessed it--\emph{summarize} your data frame.

As an example, let's use summarize to compute the average
\texttt{lifeExp} value across all rows in the dataset. If
\texttt{lifeExp} was a vector object in our space, we would compute the
average value by writing \texttt{mean(lifeExp)}. But since
\texttt{lifeExp} is not a variable in our space, it is a column in our
data, we can compute the average \texttt{lifeExp} value by providing
this \texttt{mean(lifeExp)} operation inside the \texttt{summarize()}
function as follows:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}} \FunctionTok{summarize}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{mean}\NormalTok{(lifeExp))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 1 x 1
  `mean(lifeExp)`
            <dbl>
1            59.5
\end{verbatim}

You can read this as: ``take the gapminder dataset \emph{and then}
summarize it by computing \texttt{mean(lifeExp)}, i.e., the mean of the
\texttt{lifeExp} column''.

However, like all of the other functions we have used in this chapter,
the output of \texttt{summarize()} function is itself a data frame
(albeit with just a single row and column). But notice that the name of
the column in our summary data frame is just the function that was
computed, \texttt{mean(lifeExp)}. Wouldn't it be nice if we could give
this column a nicer name? Yes it would. Fortunately, this is super easy
to do, by just providing a name for our summary operation inside the
summary() function:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}} \FunctionTok{summarize}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{mean\_life\_exp =} \FunctionTok{mean}\NormalTok{(lifeExp))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 1 x 1
  mean_life_exp
          <dbl>
1          59.5
\end{verbatim}

In this version, our one-row-one-column data frame has the column name
\texttt{mean\_life\_exp}, instead of \texttt{mean(lifeExp)}. In general,
I don't like having characters like \texttt{()} in the column names of
my data frames, but this only really matters if I plan to use my data
frame for something where I need to reference the column names (it
matters less if I just want to look at it)!

It's also super easy to compute multiple summaries at once using our
trusty comma:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}} 
  \FunctionTok{summarize}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{mean\_life\_exp =} \FunctionTok{mean}\NormalTok{(lifeExp), }
            \AttributeTok{max\_population =} \FunctionTok{max}\NormalTok{(pop))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 1 x 2
  mean_life_exp max_population
          <dbl>          <dbl>
1          59.5     1318683096
\end{verbatim}

You don't need to put each summary computation on a new line, but it
makes it a bit easier to read (e.g., compared with
\texttt{summarize(mean\_life\_exp\ =\ mean(lifeExp),\ max\_population\ =\ max(pop))}).

\section{Grouped operations with
group\_by()}\label{grouped-operations-with-group_by}

Computing a \texttt{summary()} operation across all of the rows at once
is nice and all, but I'll forgive you if you're sitting there thinking
``Ok Rebecca, I know you love the tidyverse, and you want to pipe
everything into everything else, but honestly it's just easier to use
base R notation to do this, like:''

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{mean}\NormalTok{(gapminder}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{lifeExp)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 59.47444
\end{verbatim}

And my response to you would be: yeah. It is. But just wait. The next
thing I'm going to show you will blow your mind and force you to eat
your words.

What if\ldots{} I asked you to compute the average life expectancy
again, but to do it separately \emph{for each continent}.

While you could preceed your \texttt{summarize()} operation with a
\texttt{filter()} operation for each continent like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}} \FunctionTok{filter}\NormalTok{(continent }\SpecialCharTok{==} \StringTok{"Asia"}\NormalTok{) }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}} \FunctionTok{summarize}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{mean}\NormalTok{(lifeExp))}
\end{Highlighting}

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 1 x 1

            <dbl>

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 1 x 1

            <dbl>

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 1 x 1
  `mean(lifeExp)`
            <dbl>
1            71.9
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 1 x 1
  `mean(lifeExp)`
            <dbl>
1            74.3
\end{verbatim}

Or even use a for loop (if you so desired\ldots), it turns out that
there is a better way!

The true value of the \texttt{summarize()} function lies in its
friendship with the \texttt{group\_by()} function. The following code
concisely computes the average \texttt{lifeExp} separately for each
\texttt{continent} by ``grouping'' the gapminder data frame by continent
(using \texttt{group\_by()}) \emph{before} summarizing.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}} 
  \FunctionTok{group\_by}\NormalTok{(continent) }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}} 
  \FunctionTok{summarize}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{mean\_life\_exp =} \FunctionTok{mean}\NormalTok{(lifeExp))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 5 x 2
  continent mean_life_exp
  <chr>             <dbl>
1 Africa             48.9
2 Americas           64.7
3 Asia               60.1
4 Europe             71.9
5 Oceania            74.3
\end{verbatim}

You can think about this as if \texttt{group\_by()} is creating a
separate data frame for each continent and then it is computing the
\texttt{summarize()} operation \emph{separately} for each continent data
frame, and it is then combining the summary output into a two-column
data frame, where the first column contains the respective
\texttt{continent} value, and the second column contains the result of
the \texttt{summary()} operation for that particular \texttt{continent}.

Now that's rad as heck!

\texttt{gdpPercap} column separately for each country.

\subsection{Group\_by multiple columns
simultaneously}\label{group_by-multiple-columns-simultaneously}

Just in case you weren't already impressed enough by the
group\_by/summarize duo, you can also do more sophisticated grouping
operations, such as computing the average \texttt{lifeExp} for each
continent-year * combination* by gropuing by both \texttt{continent} and
\texttt{year}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# compute the average life expectancy for each continent{-}year combination}
\NormalTok{gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}} 
  \FunctionTok{group\_by}\NormalTok{(continent, year) }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}} 
  \FunctionTok{summarize}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{mean\_life\_exp =} \FunctionTok{mean}\NormalTok{(lifeExp))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
`summarise()` has grouped output by 'continent'. You can override using the
`.groups` argument.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 60 x 3
# Groups:   continent [5]
   continent  year mean_life_exp
   <chr>     <dbl>         <dbl>
 1 Africa     1952          39.1
 2 Africa     1957          41.3
 3 Africa     1962          43.3
 4 Africa     1967          45.3
 5 Africa     1972          47.5
 6 Africa     1977          49.6
 7 Africa     1982          51.6
 8 Africa     1987          53.3

10 Africa     1997          53.6
# i 50 more rows
\end{verbatim}

With \texttt{filter()}, \texttt{mutate()}, \texttt{group\_by()}, and
\texttt{summarize()} up your sleeve, there is almost no summarization of
your data you can't do!

\section{Exercise}

Compute the mean and standard deviation of the GDP (the product of
\texttt{pop} and \texttt{gdpPercap}) separately for each year and
continent after the year 2000. Your output should look like this:

\begin{verbatim}
`summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'. You can override using the
`.groups` argument.

While \texttt{group\_by()} is most often used with \texttt{summarize()},
this doesn't mean that it can \emph{only} be used with
\texttt{summarize()}!

\subsubsection{Grouped mutates}\label{grouped-mutates}

Below, I group by \texttt{continent} and then I conduct a
\texttt{mutate()} to add a new column \texttt{max\_life\_exp},

Take a close look at the new \texttt{max\_life\_exp} column that I've
tacked onto the end of my data frame. It contains the same value within
each country! This time, I have created a new data frame object called
\texttt{gapminder\_new} because I want to continue working with this
data frame object.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Don't forget to
\texttt{ungroup()}}{Don't forget to ungroup()}}\label{dont-forget-to-ungroup}

So we've got our \texttt{gapminder\_new} object that contains our
\texttt{max\_life\_exp} column which contains the maximum life
expectancy value where the average is computed just using the
corresponding country's rows.

If I then wanted to conduct a subsequent summarize operation on this
\texttt{gapminder\_new} object, such as computing the average
\texttt{max\_life\_exp} value, with the goal of computing this average
\emph{over all rows in the data} (i.e., I should get a single value), I
might write the following code:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder\_new }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}} \FunctionTok{summarize}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{mean}\NormalTok{(max\_life\_exp))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 142 x 2
   country     `mean(max_life_exp)`
   <chr>                      <dbl>

 2 Albania                     76.4

 4 Angola                      42.7
 5 Argentina                   75.3
 6 Australia                   81.2
 7 Austria                     79.8
 8 Bahrain                     75.6

10 Belgium                     79.4
# i 132 more rows
\end{verbatim}

Is there anything surprising about the output here? The
\texttt{summary()} operation is still \emph{grouped by country}, despite
the fact that I didn't conduct another \texttt{group\_by(country)}
operation before my \texttt{summarize()} operation!

This is because \texttt{gapminder\_new} is not technically a simple data
frame\ldots{} it is a \emph{grouped} data frame.

In defining \texttt{gapminder\_new}, I used a \texttt{group\_by()}
operation, and you can see that when I print out
\texttt{gapminder\_new}, at the very top (well, technically, just under
the very top) you will see some text that says:
\texttt{\#\ Groups:\ \ \ country\ {[}142{]}}. This tells me that
\texttt{gapminder\_new} is \emph{grouped} by the country column (and
there are 142 groups). This means that any operations that I conduct on
\texttt{gapminder\_new} will also be grouped (by \texttt{country}).

If you are going to continue working with a data frame that was created
using a \texttt{group\_by()} operation, it is important to remember to
\texttt{ungroup()}, unless you want your subsequent operations to also
be grouped. This is what I really wanted to do:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder\_new }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}} \FunctionTok{ungroup}\NormalTok{() }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}} \FunctionTok{summarize}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{mean}\NormalTok{(max\_life\_exp))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 1 x 1
  `mean(max_life_exp)`
                 <dbl>
1                 68.0
\end{verbatim}

I could write all of this code without defining my intermediate
\texttt{gapminder\_new} object as follows:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}} 
  \FunctionTok{group\_by}\NormalTok{(country) }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}}
  \FunctionTok{mutate}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{max\_life\_exp =} \FunctionTok{max}\NormalTok{(lifeExp)) }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}}
  \FunctionTok{ungroup}\NormalTok{() }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}}
  \FunctionTok{summarize}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{mean}\NormalTok{(max\_life\_exp))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

                 <dbl>

\end{verbatim}

But if I forgot the \texttt{ungroup()} operation (the second-last line
above), I get:

\begin{Shaded}

  \FunctionTok{group\_by}\NormalTok{(country) }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}}

\subsection{Grouped filtering}\label{grouped-filtering}

You can also conduct grouped filtering, which will apply your filter
condition separately for each group. The most common scenario in which I
find myself doing this is when I want to do something like filter to the
row in each group with the maximum value in one of the columns, such as
filtering to the rows with the highest \texttt{lifeExp} separately
\emph{within each continent}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}}
  \FunctionTok{group\_by}\NormalTok{(continent) }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}}
  \FunctionTok{filter}\NormalTok{(lifeExp }\SpecialCharTok{==} \FunctionTok{max}\NormalTok{(lifeExp))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 5 x 6

\section{Count}\label{count}

The second-last function I want to show you in this chapter is the
\texttt{count()} function. \texttt{count()} is just a really handy
function for summarizing categorical (character/factor) variables.
\texttt{count()} creates a two-column data frame, where the first column
contains the unique values in the variable provided to \texttt{count()},
in this case \texttt{continent}, and the second column, \texttt{n},
contains the number of times that each \texttt{continent} value appears:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

3 Asia        396
4 Europe      360
5 Oceania      24
\end{verbatim}

\section{Arrange}\label{arrange}

The final function I have for you is \texttt{arrange()}, which lets you
arrange the rows of your data frame in ascending or descending order of
the values in a specific column. By default, \texttt{arrange()} will
arrange the rows in ascending order. The following will rearrange all of
the rows so that the row with the smallest \texttt{lifeExp} value will
be at the top and the row with the largest \texttt{lifeExp} value will
be at the bottom:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

# i 1,694 more rows
\end{verbatim}

For some reason, the way that you specify that the rows should be
arranged in \emph{descending} order instead is to wrap the variable name
in the \texttt{desc()} function. Now the row with the largest
\texttt{lifeExp} value will be at the top and the row with the smallest
\texttt{lifeExp} value will be at the bottom:

Technically, you could also just arrange by the negative of the column
to arrange in descending order, but I usually use the \texttt{desc()}
approach myself.

\chapter{Visualization with ggplot2}\label{visualization-with-ggplot2}

????Add that you can put your aesthetics in the ggplot() function

Now that we have learned how to manipulate our data, it's time to learn
how to visualize it!

The bread-and-butter of data visualization in R is the ggplot2 library.
Just as the dplyr functions we learned in the previous chapter, together
with the pipe \texttt{\textbar{}\textgreater{}}, equipped us with an
intuitive ``flowy'' data manipulation ``grammar'', if you will;
ggplot2's ``layered grammar of graphics'' equips us with a similarly
intuitive grammar for creating data visualizations. In fact, the
``\emph{gg}'' in ``\emph{ggplot2}'' stands for ``\emph{grammar of
graphics}''; the ``\emph{plot}'' stands for ``\emph{plot}'', and the
``\emph{2}'' stands for ``\emph{2}'' (as in, this is the second
iteration of the ggplot library that Hadley Wickham created, the first
being lost to the ether.)

In this chapter, we're going to continue working with the gapminder
dataset, and since this is a new quarto document, we need to load it
again:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(tidyverse)}
\NormalTok{gapminder }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{read\_csv}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"data/gapminder.csv"}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{gapminder}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

10 Afghanistan Asia       1997    41.8 22227415      635.
# i 1,694 more rows
\end{verbatim}

Note that I also loaded the tidyverse library again. While all of the
data visualization functions I'm going to use in this chapter come from
the ggplot2 library; ggplot, like dplyr from the previous chapter, is
one of the core tidyverse packages. This means that rather than loading
ggplot2 independently (\texttt{library(ggplot2)}), I typically just load
the tidyverse library instead (\texttt{library(tidyverse)}), since this
will load both the ggplot2 library and the dplyr library at the same
time.

Our goal in this chapter is to learn how to write the code to create
really nice publication-ready data visualizations (as well as
quick-and-dirty non-publication ready visualizations--but those are less
impressive) like this:

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-2-1.pdf}

It's worth also noting what this chapter \emph{won't} cover, which is
the principles for creating data visualiations that tell a clear and
unambiguous story, and deciding \emph{which} data visualizations to use
to answer your specific question (or how to come up with good questions,
for that matter). I can, however, point you in the direction of some
resources that \emph{do} teach you some of these things, such as
\href{https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/books}{Storytelling with
Data} by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic, which is a great resources for
learning how to produce effective graphics in general,
\href{https://book.rfortherestofus.com/}{R for the Rest of Us: A
Statistics-Free Introduction} by David Keyes, and even the chapter on
data visualization of my book with Bin Yu,
\href{https://vdsbook.com/05-data_viz}{Veridical Data Science}.

Fortunately, once armed with the dplyr functions from the previous
chapter, and the ggplot2 functions from this chapter, you'll have the
coding skills you need to tackle almost any dataset that comes your way.

\section{The ggplot2 canvas}\label{the-ggplot2-canvas}

To create a ggplot figure, you start by creating an empty ggplot2
``canvas'' using the \texttt{ggplot()} function. Our ``canvas'' here is
the following grey box:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-3-1.pdf}

The first thing I need to do is to tell ggplot which dataset object
(generally, a data frame/tibble) I am going to use to create my plot,
and I do that by providing the name of my data object as the argument of
\texttt{ggplot()}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(gapminder)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-4-1.pdf}

Nothing has changed on our canvas, but now when we add some ``layers''
to our plot, ggplot can find the variables that exist within our
dataset.

To \emph{add} a layer to my plot, I literally use the plus symbol,
\texttt{+}. The name of the layer that creates a scatterplot is
\texttt{geom\_point()} (because a scattplot is made up of a collection
of ``points'').

I can add my points layer like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(gapminder) }\SpecialCharTok{+} \FunctionTok{geom\_point}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Error in `geom_point()`:
! Problem while setting up geom.
i Error occurred in the 1st layer.
Caused by error in `compute_geom_1()`:
! `geom_point()` requires the following missing aesthetics: x and y.
\end{verbatim}

But I got an error because I haven't told ggplot which columns/variables
in my data I want to use to define my scatterplot. Specifically, I need
to tell it which columns should define the x- and y-coordinates of my
scatterplot points. I do that by providing an ``aesthetics'' function as
the argument of my points layer, in which I specify which column defines
the x-coordinate (\texttt{x\ =\ gdpPercap}) and which column defines the
y-coordinate (\texttt{y\ =\ lifeExp}).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(gapminder) }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{geom\_point}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ gdpPercap, }\AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-6-1.pdf}

Now we have our scatterplot, and ggplot has even very kindly provided x-
and y-axis names! Gee, thanks!

Unfortunately ggplot is a little bit dumb, and it can only find your
data frame columns when they are referenced inside the \texttt{aes()}
function.

If I reproduced this code without the \texttt{aes()} function, I get an
error telling me that
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}gdpPercap\textquotesingle{}} cannot be found:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(gapminder) }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{geom\_point}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ gdpPercap, }\AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'gdpPercap' not found
\end{verbatim}

Basically, if I try to reference a column from my data frame outside of
the \texttt{aes()} function, ggplot will look for an object in my space
with the same name as the column, in this case \texttt{gdpPercap}, and
it won't be able to find one!

I like to think of the aesthetics function \texttt{aes()} as a secret
code that tells ggplot that the objects I'm referring to are columns of
my data frame.

Since \texttt{ggplot()} is just a function, I can also pipe my data into
it like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}} 
  \FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{() }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{geom\_point}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ gdpPercap, }\AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-8-1.pdf}

Why might I want to do that? I do this a lot, usually because I often
want to make minor modifications to my data before plotting it (but I
don't want to create a new intermediate object).

For example, if I want to recreate this scatterplot just for the year
2007, I could conduct a filter step and then pipe my filtered data frame
into \texttt{ggplot()}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}}
  \FunctionTok{filter}\NormalTok{(year }\SpecialCharTok{==} \DecValTok{2007}\NormalTok{) }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}}
  \FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{() }\SpecialCharTok{+}
  \FunctionTok{geom\_point}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ gdpPercap, }\AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-9-1.pdf}

\section{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{+} versus
\texttt{\textbar{}\textgreater{}}}{+ versus \textbar\textgreater{}}}\label{versus}

Probably one of the most common errors I make when doing data analysis
is getting confused about when I should use \texttt{+} and when I should
use \texttt{\textbar{}\textgreater{}}.

When we are adding ggplot layers, we always use \texttt{+}, but when we
are chaining functions together, we use the pipe,
\texttt{\textbar{}\textgreater{}}.

To understand why, remember that the pipe,
\texttt{\textbar{}\textgreater{}} takes the object on the left and
places it into the first argument of the function on the right. This is
not what our ggplot2 functions are doing though, these are layering
objects on top of one another, and so they use \texttt{+} instead of
\texttt{\textbar{}\textgreater{}}.

Take a look at this code, and notice when we use \texttt{+} versus
\texttt{\textbar{}\textgreater{}}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}}
  \FunctionTok{filter}\NormalTok{(year }\SpecialCharTok{==} \DecValTok{2007}\NormalTok{) }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}}
  \FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{() }\SpecialCharTok{+}
  \FunctionTok{geom\_point}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ gdpPercap, }\AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The alternative to applying my filtering step and creating my plot all
at once is defining a new object just containing the gapminder data for
2007, and providing this filtered data frame object as the argument of
the \texttt{ggplot()} function:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# define a new data frame}
\NormalTok{gapminder\_2007 }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}} \FunctionTok{filter}\NormalTok{(year }\SpecialCharTok{==} \DecValTok{2007}\NormalTok{)}
\CommentTok{\# provide this data frame as the argument of my ggplot() function}
\FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(gapminder\_2007) }\SpecialCharTok{+}
  \FunctionTok{geom\_point}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ gdpPercap, }\AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-11-1.pdf}

When do you think I might prefer to do the ``all-at-once'' approach:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}} 
  \FunctionTok{filter}\NormalTok{(year }\SpecialCharTok{==} \DecValTok{2007}\NormalTok{) }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}} 
  \FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{() }\SpecialCharTok{+}
  \FunctionTok{geom\_point}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ gdpPercap, }\AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

versus defining an intermediate \texttt{gapminder\_2007} object and then
creating my plot with \texttt{ggplot(gapminder\_2007)}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder\_2007 }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}} \FunctionTok{filter}\NormalTok{(year }\SpecialCharTok{==} \DecValTok{2007}\NormalTok{)}
\FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(gapminder\_2007) }\SpecialCharTok{+}
  \FunctionTok{geom\_point}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ gdpPercap, }\AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Basically, if I am going to use the filtered version of data for
anything other than just this single plot (e.g., if I am going to create
several plots using just the data from 2007), then I would prefer to
define the \texttt{gapminder\_2007} object and use this in my
\texttt{ggplot()} argument, rather than conduct the filtering every
time. But if this is the only time I am going to use this 2007 data,
then I would prefer to avoid defining an unnecessary object.

In general, if you are performing the same action multiple times, for
example, to create several different plots, then it's more efficient to
create an object that you can reuse.

For instance, having defined \texttt{gapminder\_2007}, I can use it to
also create a different plot, this time a histogram of \texttt{lifeExp}
values in 2007:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(gapminder\_2007) }\SpecialCharTok{+}
  \FunctionTok{geom\_histogram}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-14-1.pdf}

Note that to create a histogram using \texttt{geom\_histogram()}, I just
need to give it the x-axis variable, \texttt{lifeExp}, and it will do
all of the binning and tallying up of counts needed to determine the
y-axis for me.

\section{Defining ggplot2 aesthetics}\label{defining-ggplot2-aesthetics}

\texttt{x} and \texttt{y} are ``aesthetic'' properties of the points in
a scatterplot, and \texttt{x} is an ``aesthetic'' property of the bars
in a histogram. But they aren't the \emph{only} aesthetic properties
that we can specify!

For example, some other scatterplot aesthetic properties that we can
specify include \texttt{color}, \texttt{size}, and \texttt{shape}.

You can specify the \texttt{color} of the points using the
\texttt{color} aesthetic:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(gapminder\_2007) }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{geom\_point}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ gdpPercap, }\AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp, }\AttributeTok{color =}\NormalTok{ continent))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-17-1.pdf}

In this example, I'm specifying \texttt{color\ =\ continent} inside the
\texttt{aes()} function, which, because it is inside the \texttt{aes()}
function, this tells ggplot2 that \texttt{continent} is a column in my
data and that it should come up with a unique color for each unique
\texttt{continent} value.

What if I wanted to just make all of the points in my scatterplot
``blue'' instead of based on the continent column, like this:

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-18-1.pdf}

If I try to just replace \texttt{color\ =\ continent} with
\texttt{color\ =\ "blue"} (where I'm providing quotes around ``blue''
because I want to specifically pass the \emph{character} value ``blue'',
not a column or variable callued \texttt{blue}), it doesn't work:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(gapminder\_2007) }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{geom\_point}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ gdpPercap, }\AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp, }\AttributeTok{color =} \StringTok{"blue"}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-19-1.pdf}

Since \texttt{color\ =\ "blue"} is specified \emph{inside} the
\texttt{aes()} function, ggplot is looking for a column inside the
\texttt{gapminder} data frame called \texttt{"blue"}, and since it can't
find one, it just creates one and populates it entirely with the value
``blue'' for all data points, so what we end up with is a scatterplot
whose color is deteremined by a categorical variable whose value
consists of a single value, which is just the word ``blue'', and since
this variable only has a single value, ggplot only provides one color,
and this color is just the first default ggplot2 color which is this
nice ``salmony'' color.

If you want to define an aesthetic of your plot that does \emph{not}
depend on a column in your data, you need to specify it \emph{outside}
the \texttt{aes()} function. If we just move the
\texttt{color\ =\ "blue"} argument \emph{outside} \texttt{aes()}, we get
what we wanted:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(gapminder\_2007) }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{geom\_point}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ gdpPercap, }\AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp), }\AttributeTok{color =} \StringTok{"blue"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\subsection{Transparency}\label{transparency}

Sometimes when you have a lot of data points all sitting ontop of one
another, it can be helpful to add some transparency. You can do this
using the \texttt{alpha} argument.

\texttt{alpha} takes values between 0 and 1. \texttt{alpha\ =\ 1} is not
transparent at all, and \texttt{alpha\ =\ 0} is completely transparent.
The scatterplot below has \texttt{alpha\ =\ 0.5}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(gapminder\_2007) }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{geom\_point}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ gdpPercap, }\AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp), }
             \AttributeTok{alpha =} \FloatTok{0.5}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-23-1.pdf}

Since we are not using a column/variable in the data frame to specify
\texttt{alpha}, note that it is \emph{outside} the \texttt{aes()}
function of \texttt{geom\_point()}.

\section{Exercise}

Recreate the 2007 \texttt{gdpPercap} vs \texttt{lifeExp} plot where each
point has color determined by \texttt{continent}, size determined by
\texttt{pop}, and all the points have a transparency of 0.5.

\section{Other kinds of plots}\label{other-kinds-of-plots}

\subsection{Line plots}\label{line-plots}

Line plots are great for showing how things change over time.

If I want to see how \texttt{lifeExp} changes by year, I can try to
create a line plot using \texttt{geom\_line()} with \texttt{lifeExp} on
the y-axis, and \texttt{year} on the x-axis:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(gapminder) }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{geom\_line}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ year, }
                \AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-25-1.pdf}

Ugh. gross. I don't like this plot at all. It looks terrible. What's
with all the zigzags?

Can you figure out what's going on in this plot? As a hint\ldots{} how
many \texttt{lifeExp} values do we have for each \texttt{year}? We have
many! One for each country (and there are almost 200 countries!)

Here are all the \texttt{lifeExp} values corresponding to 1962

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}}
  \FunctionTok{filter}\NormalTok{(year }\SpecialCharTok{==} \DecValTok{1962}\NormalTok{) }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}} 
  \FunctionTok{select}\NormalTok{(year, country, lifeExp)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 142 x 3
    year country     lifeExp
   <dbl> <chr>         <dbl>
 1  1962 Afghanistan    32.0
 2  1962 Albania        64.8
 3  1962 Algeria        48.3
 4  1962 Angola         34  
 5  1962 Argentina      65.1
 6  1962 Australia      70.9
 7  1962 Austria        69.5
 8  1962 Bahrain        56.9
 9  1962 Bangladesh     41.2
10  1962 Belgium        70.2
# i 132 more rows
\end{verbatim}

so the vertical lines we see in our ``line plot'' above correspond to
the range of \texttt{lifeExp} values for each year, and then it probably
just connects the final \texttt{lifeExp} value that year to the first
\texttt{lifeExp} value for the next year, and those are the diagonal
lines that we see.

In general, to create a single line, we want just \emph{one} value for
the y-axis (e.g., \texttt{lifeExp}) per x-axis value (e.g.,
\texttt{year}). To satisfy this requirement, we can look at the data for
just \emph{one} country

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}} 
  \FunctionTok{filter}\NormalTok{(country }\SpecialCharTok{==} \StringTok{"Australia"}\NormalTok{) }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}}
  \FunctionTok{select}\NormalTok{(year, country, lifeExp)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 12 x 3
    year country   lifeExp
   <dbl> <chr>       <dbl>
 1  1952 Australia    69.1
 2  1957 Australia    70.3
 3  1962 Australia    70.9
 4  1967 Australia    71.1
 5  1972 Australia    71.9
 6  1977 Australia    73.5
 7  1982 Australia    74.7
 8  1987 Australia    76.3
 9  1992 Australia    77.6
10  1997 Australia    78.8
11  2002 Australia    80.4
12  2007 Australia    81.2
\end{verbatim}

Now, we have just one \texttt{lifeExp} value for each \texttt{year}, and
we could create a line plot using these values:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}} 
  \FunctionTok{filter}\NormalTok{(country }\SpecialCharTok{==} \StringTok{"Australia"}\NormalTok{) }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}}
  \FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{() }\SpecialCharTok{+}
  \FunctionTok{geom\_line}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ year, }\AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-28-1.pdf}

Gee wiz! That looks way better! It's a single line, and boy-oh-boy it
sure looks like we Aussies are living longer and longer! Onya Mate!

I could make the same plot for the US, by filtering to the US instead of
Australia:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}} 
  \FunctionTok{filter}\NormalTok{(country }\SpecialCharTok{==} \StringTok{"United States"}\NormalTok{) }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}}
  \FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{() }\SpecialCharTok{+}
  \FunctionTok{geom\_line}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ year, }\AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-29-1.pdf}

What if I wanted to make a plot with \emph{both} of these lines on it?

Well there are a few ways I could do that. One is good, and another is
not so good.

I'll show you the not-so-good approach first, just so you can really
appreciate the good approach.

The not-so-good approach involfe creating data frames for Australia and
the US and adding multiple line layers. The first line layer will be
just using \texttt{gapminder\_us}, the data frame for the US and the
second line layer will have its own \texttt{data} argument to which I'll
pass \texttt{gapminder\_au}, the data frame for Australia:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# define the data frame for the US}
\NormalTok{gapminder\_us }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}}
  \FunctionTok{filter}\NormalTok{(country }\SpecialCharTok{==} \StringTok{"United States"}\NormalTok{)}

\CommentTok{\# define the data frame for the australia}
\NormalTok{gapminder\_au }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}}
  \FunctionTok{filter}\NormalTok{(country }\SpecialCharTok{==} \StringTok{"Australia"}\NormalTok{)}

\CommentTok{\# Create a line plot for the US and then add a line plot layer for Australia}
\FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(gapminder\_us) }\SpecialCharTok{+}
  \FunctionTok{geom\_line}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ year, }\AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp)) }\SpecialCharTok{+}
  \FunctionTok{geom\_line}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ year, }\AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp),}
            \AttributeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ gapminder\_au)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-30-1.pdf}

Here the first \texttt{geom\_line()} layer is based on the
\texttt{gapminder\_us} data frame provided as the argument of
\texttt{ggplot()}, and the second one is based on the
\texttt{gapminder\_au} data frame provided in the \texttt{data} argument
of the second \texttt{geom\_line()} layer (when you don't provide a
\texttt{data} argument, each layer will be based on the data frame
provided to \texttt{ggplot()})

While this technically works, this approach sucks for a few reasons.
First, I can't tell which line is which. There is no legend (and it's
unfortunately not all that easy to add a legend manually to a ggplot2
figure). Another reason this approach sucks is that it's not scalable.
If I wanted to do this for 10 countries, I'd have to create 10 different
data frames and add 10 line layers to my plot! No thanks.

Instead of adding separate line layers for each country, I can instead
use the \texttt{color} or \texttt{group} aesthetic to tell
\texttt{ggplot()} that I want separate lines for each country, say.

In the code below, I create a data frame that contains the data for both
Australia and the US, and then I create a ggplot2 line plot, specifying
\texttt{color\ =\ country} inside my \texttt{aes()} function, which will
give me a separate line for each country:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}}
  \FunctionTok{filter}\NormalTok{(country }\SpecialCharTok{\%in\%} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"Australia"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"United States"}\NormalTok{)) }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}}
  \FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{() }\SpecialCharTok{+}
  \FunctionTok{geom\_line}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ year, }\AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp, }\AttributeTok{color =}\NormalTok{ country))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-31-1.pdf}

An alternative if I want a separate line for each country, but I don't
want each line to have a different color, is to use the \texttt{group}
aesthetic instead of the \texttt{color} aesthetic:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}}
  \FunctionTok{filter}\NormalTok{(country }\SpecialCharTok{\%in\%} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"Australia"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"United States"}\NormalTok{)) }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}}
  \FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{() }\SpecialCharTok{+}
  \FunctionTok{geom\_line}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ year, }\AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp, }\AttributeTok{group =}\NormalTok{ country))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-32-1.pdf}

The following code create a line plot of lifeExp by year for each
country on the Americas content (with no colors or legend).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}} 
  \FunctionTok{filter}\NormalTok{(continent }\SpecialCharTok{==} \StringTok{"Americas"}\NormalTok{) }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}} 
  \FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{() }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{geom\_line}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ year, }
                \AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp, }
                \AttributeTok{group =}\NormalTok{ country))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\section{Exercise}

Compute the average life expectancy for each continent for each year,
and then create a line plot of the average life expectancy for each
continent over time (each continent should have it's own different
colored line).

Here is an example of the plot I want you to make:

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-34-1.pdf}

\section{Solution}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

                \AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ mean\_life\_exp, }
                \AttributeTok{color =}\NormalTok{ continent))}
\end{Highlighting}

\begin{verbatim}
`summarise()` has grouped output by 'continent'. You can override using the
`.groups` argument.
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-35-1.pdf}

\subsection{Boxplots}\label{boxplots}

Like scatterplots created with \texttt{geom\_point()}, boxplots created
with a \texttt{geom\_boxplot()} layer desire an \texttt{x} and a
\texttt{y} aesthetic, however, unlike \texttt{geom\_point()} which wants
both the \texttt{x} and \texttt{y} variables to be continuous numeric
variables, \texttt{geom\_boxplot()} wants \emph{one} of the \texttt{x}
and \texttt{y} aesthetics to be a categorical (character or factor)
variable and the other one to be numeric--\texttt{geom\_boxplot()} will
create a separate boxplot for each categorical value.

For example, below we create a boxplot of \texttt{lifeExp} for each
value of \texttt{continent}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(gapminder) }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{geom\_boxplot}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ continent, }\AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-36-1.pdf}

The bottom of the box of a boxplot corresponds to \(Q_1\), the first
quartile of the variable (the value for which 25\% of values are less
than it) and the top of the box corresponds to the third quartile,
\(Q_3\) of the variable (the value for which 75\% of values are less
than it). The bar in the middle is the median, which corresponds to the
second quartile, \(Q_2\) (the value for which 50\% of values are less
than it). The lines that extend from the bottom and top of the boxplot
reach as far as \(Q_1 - 1.5 (Q_3 - Q_1)\) and \(Q_3 + 1.5 (Q_3 - Q_1)\),
respectively, and all values that are outside this range are shown as
points and are called ``outliers.''

If you switch the \texttt{x} and the \texttt{y} so that the \texttt{y}
aesthetic is the categorical/character \texttt{continent} variable, then
you get horizontal boxplots instead.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(gapminder) }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{geom\_boxplot}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp, }\AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ continent))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-37-1.pdf}

\texttt{geom\_boxplot()} is great for creating side-by-side boxplots for
the different levels/values of a categorical variable.

But you can create single boxplots for an entire variable, such as
\texttt{lifeExp}, by just providing \texttt{y\ =\ lifeExp} to your
aesthetic function (leaving \texttt{x} out entirely):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(gapminder) }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{geom\_boxplot}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-38-1.pdf}

But I rarely do this--I find that boxplots are most helpful for
\emph{comparing} the distributions of a variable across different
groups.

\subsection{Histograms}\label{histograms}

If I want to look at the distribution of a single variable, I find it
more useful to use a histogram, such as the histogram of
\texttt{lifeExp} below:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(gapminder) }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{geom\_histogram}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-39-1.pdf}

A histogram essentially takes the range of a continuous numeric
variable, chops it up into binned intervals, and then uses bars to
represent how many values fall into each binned interval.

I don't really like that the histogram doesn't provide outlines for each
of the bars, so I often add them in by providing a \texttt{color} value
\emph{outside} the \texttt{aes()} function:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(gapminder) }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{geom\_histogram}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp), }
                 \AttributeTok{color =} \StringTok{"white"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-40-1.pdf}

Notice that \texttt{color} here refers to the \emph{outline} of the
bars, rather than the bars themselves. If you want the bars themselves
to have a different color, you need to use the \texttt{fill} aesthetic.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(gapminder) }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{geom\_histogram}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp), }
                 \AttributeTok{color =} \StringTok{"white"}\NormalTok{,}
                 \AttributeTok{fill =} \StringTok{"cornflowerblue"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-41-1.pdf}

You can also provide a \texttt{fill} to your histogram where the bars
are colored using a categorical variable, such as \texttt{continent}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(gapminder) }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{geom\_histogram}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp, }\AttributeTok{fill =}\NormalTok{ continent), }
                 \AttributeTok{color =} \StringTok{"white"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-42-1.pdf}

But be warned that these bars are \emph{``stacked''} on top of one
another, so the overall shape is the same as that of the entire variable
in the histograms above.

If you want to compare the distributions of the \texttt{lifeExp}
variable across each continent where each continent's histogram starts
from 0, you need to specify an additional argument to
\texttt{geom\_histogram()} that is \texttt{position\ =\ "identity"}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(gapminder) }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{geom\_histogram}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp, }\AttributeTok{fill =}\NormalTok{ continent), }
                 \AttributeTok{color =} \StringTok{"white"}\NormalTok{,}
                 \AttributeTok{position =} \StringTok{"identity"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.
\end{verbatim}

Now each continent's histograms start at y = 0, but because they are
opaque, it is a hard to see the distributions where they overlap.

This is another place where transparency comes in handy! If we set
\texttt{alpha\ =\ 0.5}, we can see a bit more easily how the
distributionso overlap.

\begin{Shaded}

This plot is a bit busy though, so it might be a bit easier to just
compare two groups, such as ``Europe'' and ``Africa'':

  \FunctionTok{filter}\NormalTok{(continent }\SpecialCharTok{\%in\%} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"Europe"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Africa"}\NormalTok{)) }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}}

                 \AttributeTok{position =} \StringTok{"identity"}\NormalTok{,}

\begin{verbatim}
`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Bar charts}\label{bar-charts}

A bar chart is like a histogram, but for categorical variables instead
of continuous numeric ones.

You can create a \emph{count} bar chart, by providing a categorical
(character/factor) variable as your x-aesthetic to \texttt{geom\_bar()},
which will then add up how many times each value of the categorical
variable appears and use this as the height of the bars:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# create a bar chart of the continent *counts*}
\FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(gapminder) }\SpecialCharTok{+}
  \FunctionTok{geom\_bar}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ continent))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-46-1.pdf}

If you want to create bar charts where you specify the height of each
bar based on a variable in your data, you want to use
\texttt{geom\_col()} instead of \texttt{geom\_bar()}.

For example, below, I create a bar chart that shows the \emph{average
life expectancy} for each continent, first you have to calculate the
average life expectancy for each continent, and then you can pipe that
into ggplot with a \texttt{geom\_col()} layer that uses
\texttt{x\ =\ continent} as the x-aesthetic that specifies how many bars
there are (and their names), and your calculated
\texttt{y\ =\ mean\_life\_exp} as the height aesthetic.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}}
  \FunctionTok{group\_by}\NormalTok{(continent) }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}}
  \FunctionTok{summarize}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{mean\_life\_exp =} \FunctionTok{mean}\NormalTok{(lifeExp)) }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}}
  \FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{() }\SpecialCharTok{+}
  \FunctionTok{geom\_col}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ continent, }\AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ mean\_life\_exp))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-47-1.pdf}

Note that like histograms, you can give each bar a color using the
\texttt{fill} aesthetic.

To give each bar a different color per continent, provide
\texttt{fill\ =\ continent} \emph{inside} the \texttt{aes()} function:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}}
  \FunctionTok{group\_by}\NormalTok{(continent) }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}}
  \FunctionTok{summarize}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{mean\_life\_exp =} \FunctionTok{mean}\NormalTok{(lifeExp)) }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}}
  \FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{() }\SpecialCharTok{+}
  \FunctionTok{geom\_col}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ continent, }\AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ mean\_life\_exp, }\AttributeTok{fill =}\NormalTok{ continent))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-48-1.pdf}

And to give each bar the same global color, provide your color to
\texttt{fill} \emph{outside} the \texttt{aes()} function:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}}
  \FunctionTok{group\_by}\NormalTok{(continent) }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}}
  \FunctionTok{summarize}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{mean\_life\_exp =} \FunctionTok{mean}\NormalTok{(lifeExp)) }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}}
  \FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{() }\SpecialCharTok{+}
  \FunctionTok{geom\_col}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ continent, }\AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ mean\_life\_exp),}
           \AttributeTok{fill =} \StringTok{"cornflowerblue"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-49-1.pdf}

\section{Getting fancy with ggplot2}\label{getting-fancy-with-ggplot2}

Now that you've seen the most common ggplot2 layers that I typically
use, let's talk about how to do even fancier things with them.

\subsection{Transformations}\label{transformations}

You can apply log-scale transformations to your axis by adding a scale
layer. Below, the layer \texttt{scale\_x\_log10()} converts the x-axis
to a \(\log_{10}\) scale, so each break increases by an order of
magnitude rather than by a fixed amount.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(gapminder\_2007) }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{geom\_point}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ gdpPercap, }
                 \AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp, }
                 \AttributeTok{color =}\NormalTok{ continent)) }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{scale\_x\_log10}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-50-1.pdf}

Because I want to keep using this plot as I show you more cool things,
I'm going to save it as a variable!

I can do this by assigning it to a new variable name like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{life\_gdp\_scatter }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(gapminder\_2007) }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{geom\_point}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ gdpPercap, }
                 \AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp, }
                 \AttributeTok{color =}\NormalTok{ continent)) }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{scale\_x\_log10}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

As usual, when I define this variable, no output is shown, but I can
look at the object contained in this variable by typing its name:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{life\_gdp\_scatter}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-52-1.pdf}

And the super neat thing is that because this is just a ggplot object, I
can keep adding things to it!

\subsection{Labels}\label{labels}

You can clean the labels of your figure by adding a \texttt{labs()}
layer.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{life\_gdp\_scatter }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{labs}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =} \StringTok{"GDP per capita"}\NormalTok{, }
       \AttributeTok{y =} \StringTok{"Life expectancy"}\NormalTok{, }
       \AttributeTok{title =} \StringTok{"GDP per cap vs life expectancy"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-53-1.pdf}

This is equivalent to replacing \texttt{life\_gdp\_scatter} with the
code that was used to define it

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(gapminder\_2007) }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{geom\_point}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ gdpPercap, }
                 \AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp, }
                 \AttributeTok{color =}\NormalTok{ continent)) }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{scale\_x\_log10}\NormalTok{() }\SpecialCharTok{+}
  \FunctionTok{labs}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =} \StringTok{"GDP per capita"}\NormalTok{, }
       \AttributeTok{y =} \StringTok{"Life expectancy"}\NormalTok{, }
       \AttributeTok{title =} \StringTok{"GDP per cap vs life expectancy"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-54-1.pdf}

And I'm going to update my scatterplot object to contain these new
labels:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{life\_gdp\_scatter }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ life\_gdp\_scatter }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{labs}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =} \StringTok{"GDP per capita"}\NormalTok{, }
       \AttributeTok{y =} \StringTok{"Life expectancy"}\NormalTok{, }
       \AttributeTok{title =} \StringTok{"GDP per cap vs life expectancy"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\subsection{Themes}\label{themes}

Next, I want to give my figure a theme by adding a themes layer. There
are a lot of theme options. My favorite is \texttt{theme\_classic()}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{life\_gdp\_scatter }\SpecialCharTok{+} \FunctionTok{theme\_classic}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-56-1.pdf}

Another popular one is \texttt{theme\_bw()}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{life\_gdp\_scatter }\SpecialCharTok{+} \FunctionTok{theme\_bw}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-57-1.pdf}

and \texttt{theme\_minimal()}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{life\_gdp\_scatter }\SpecialCharTok{+} \FunctionTok{theme\_minimal}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-58-1.pdf}

But there are
\href{https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html}{lots of
others too}.

\subsection{Faceted grids}\label{faceted-grids}

The last neat ggplot2 thing I want to show you is how to create a grid
of plots using \texttt{facet\_wrap()}.

If I have a bunch of line plots on the same plot like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}}
  \FunctionTok{filter}\NormalTok{(continent }\SpecialCharTok{==} \StringTok{"Americas"}\NormalTok{) }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}}
  \FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{() }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{geom\_line}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ year, }
                \AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp, }
                \AttributeTok{group =}\NormalTok{ country))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-59-1.pdf}

I might find myself wishing that I had a separate plot for each country,
but I don't want to actually write the code to create a separate line
plot for each country manually.

Fortunately, \texttt{facet\_wrap()} (and \texttt{facet\_grid()}) can do
this for me. Below I take the exact same code and I add a
\texttt{facet\_wrap()} layer where I specify which categorical variable
in my data I want to use to specify the different plot panels (I write
\texttt{\textasciitilde{}country} to create a separate panel for each
value in country). This is essentially just taking each line in the plot
above and giving it its own plot. Each plot will inherit the aesthetic
properties of the \texttt{geom\_line()} layer.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}}
  \FunctionTok{filter}\NormalTok{(continent }\SpecialCharTok{==} \StringTok{"Americas"}\NormalTok{) }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}}
  \FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{() }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{geom\_line}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ year, }
                \AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp)) }\SpecialCharTok{+}
  \FunctionTok{facet\_wrap}\NormalTok{(}\SpecialCharTok{\textasciitilde{}}\NormalTok{country)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-60-1.pdf}

This plot is all cramped, but if I add some
\texttt{\#\textbar{}\ fig-height} and \texttt{\#\textbar{}\ fig-width}
options to the top of my code chunk, I can control its size, such as

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\InformationTok{\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}\{r\}}
\InformationTok{\#| fig{-}height: 8}
\InformationTok{\#| fig{-}width: 8}
\InformationTok{gapminder |\textgreater{}}
\InformationTok{  filter(continent == "Americas") |\textgreater{}}
\InformationTok{  ggplot() + }
\InformationTok{  geom\_line(aes(x = year, }
\InformationTok{                y = lifeExp)) +}
\InformationTok{  facet\_wrap(\textasciitilde{}country)}
\InformationTok{\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-61-1.pdf}

Note that I also rotated my x-axis text 90 degrees using a
\texttt{theme()} layer. If you want to start truly customizing your your
ggplots, you're going to get intimately familiar with the
\texttt{theme()} layer options.

You can also specify the number of columns in your faceted grid using
the \texttt{ncol} argument:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}}
  \FunctionTok{filter}\NormalTok{(continent }\SpecialCharTok{==} \StringTok{"Americas"}\NormalTok{) }\SpecialCharTok{|\textgreater{}}
  \FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{() }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{geom\_line}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ year, }
                \AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ lifeExp)) }\SpecialCharTok{+}
  \FunctionTok{facet\_wrap}\NormalTok{(}\SpecialCharTok{\textasciitilde{}}\NormalTok{country, }\AttributeTok{ncol =} \DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{06_ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-62-1.pdf}

\section{Exercise}

Create a faceted grid of scatterplots of \texttt{lifeExp} against
\texttt{gdpPercap} in 2007 for each continent. Do some fancy things to
make your plot sparkle!
